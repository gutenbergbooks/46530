<p>'We cannot help expressing our delight with Mr. W. H. Tregellas's masterly
"Guide to Cornwall and the Scilly Isles." Mr. Tregellas is an
accomplished antiquary and scholar, and writes with love and complete
knowledge of his subject. For anyone interested in one of the most interesting
English counties we could recommend no better guide to its geology,
history, people, old language, industries, antiquities, as well as topography;
and the well-selected list of writers on Cornwall will be of the greatest
service in enabling the reader to pursue the subject to its limits.'&mdash;<cite>The Times.</cite></p>

<p>'A capital Guide to Cornwall.'&mdash;<cite>The Athen√¶um.</cite></p>

<p>'Mr. Tregellas has compiled his Guide with great judgment. The general
tourist could not desire a better companion.'&mdash;<cite>The Academy.</cite></p>

<p>'The volume is written in a style much superior to that usually found in
guide-books, and every page is full of just the kind of information that is
being constantly looked for during a holiday trip.'&mdash;<cite>The Examiner.</cite></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Grenvilles.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="#Page_67">Vol. ii., p. 67</a>.)</p>

<p>John Grenville (afterwards Earl of Bath) was Lieutenant-General
of the Ordnance 1702-5.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sir Bevill Grenville.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="#Page_64">Vol. ii., p. 64</a>.)</p>

<p>I am indebted to a recent very interesting biography of Sir Bevill by
Mr. Alfred R. Robbins (which I did not see until the chapter on the
Grenvilles had gone through the press) for information on the following
points, which had escaped my notice.</p>

<p>Sir Bevill gave a silver cup to Exeter College.</p>

<p>He secured the success of Eliot's election, no doubt on account of
strong personal friendship, as an anti-loan candidate about 1628.
Bagg wrote to the Duke of Buckingham that he desired to have Eliot,
Grenville, and John Arundell 'outlawed and put out of the House'
... 'for here we had Beville Grenville, John Arundell, and Charles
Trevanion coming to the election with five hundred men at each of
their heels.'</p>

<p>He was one of the executors named by Eliot in his will.</p>

<p>He was much encumbered with the debts of his ancestors, and
sold (amongst other property) Brinn, his birthplace, to Sir William
Noye, the Attorney-General.</p>

<p>He objected to the Bill of Attainder against Strafford, and wrote to
his fellow Cornishman, Sir Alexander Carew, 'Pray, sir, when it
comes to be put to the vote, let it never be said that any member of
our country (county) should have a hand in this fatal business; and
therefore pray ye give your vote against the Bill.' But this Carew
stoutly refused to do.</p>

<p>He refused the summons of the Parliament 'to attend the service of
the House,' pleading the King's special command to continue in his
county to preserve the peace thereof; whereupon a resolution was
passed disabling him from continuing to be a member.</p>

<p>His praises, after his death, were sung, not only by his old University
of Oxford, but also by Sir Francis Wortley in his 'Characters and
Elegies,' in 1646; by Robert Heath, in 1650; and by William Cartwright,
in 1651.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Killigrews.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="#Page_119">Vol. ii., p. 119</a>.)</p>

<p>The 1st Thos. Killigrew was buried at Gluvias, not at Budock.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The St. Aubyns.</span></p>

<p>The letter signed 'Frances Godolphin,' <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/46529/46529-h/46529-h.htm#Page_173">vol. i., p. 173</a>, should read

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">In</span> his 'Worthies of Devon,' Prince, no
doubt willingly enough, offers a compromise
with Cornwall as to the ownership
of the Grenvilles, and quotes Dugdale
and Fuller to the effect that both Cornwall and
Devon are so fruitful of illustrious men, that each can
spare to the other a hero or two, even if wrongfully
deprived of her own; even Carew has a somewhat
similar passage, in which he says, 'The merits of
this ancient family are so many and so great, that
ingrossed they would make one County proud, which,
divided, would make two happy.'</p>

<p>But, as it appears to me, Cornwall <em>could</em> not, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
if she would, spare the Grenvilles&mdash;especially the
two most celebrated of them, Sir Richard and Sir
Bevill&mdash;from her roll of Worthies. True it is that
the Grenvilles usually took the sea at Bideford (By-the-ford),
for it was their nearest port, though they
always kept a keen eye upon the possibility of utilizing
Boscastle, Tintagel and other North Cornwall ports;
true also that Sir Theobald Grenville (probably with
the assistance of a priest named Sir Richard Gornard,
or Gurney, and others), who flourished in the reign
of Edward III., mainly built the famous great Bideford
bridge of twenty-four arches; doubtless, too,
they had lands and knights' fees, and a house or
houses at Bideford in which they occasionally
resided: but the <em>seat</em> of the Grenvilles was, from at
least the time of William Rufus, at Stow (which
even Prince calls 'their chiefest habitation'<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>), in the
parish of Kilkhampton, well within the Cornish
border, and separated, on the northern side, from
the fair sister county of Devon by the whole of the
broad parish of Morwenstow.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> For five centuries
or more their monuments were placed in Kilkhampton
Church, on which they bestowed from time
to time many benefactions, and of which parish
many members of the family were Rectors. Carew
says that one of the Grenvilles was parson of Kilkhampton,
and that he lived so long as to see himself
uncle and great-uncle to more than 300 persons:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>this was probably John Grenville, temp. Edward IV.
Of another Rector of this parish the Rev. C. W. Boase,
in his 'Registers of Exeter College,' has recorded
that, shortly after the year 1316, Richard Grenfield
founded a chest of money for making loans to the
poor scholars of that Society. According to Lake's
'Parochial History of Cornwall,' the following
Grenvilles were Rectors of Kilkhampton, namely:
Richard, son of Sir Bart<sup>w</sup>. Grenville, 1312; John
Grenville, 1524, who also held Week St. Mary;
Dennis Grenville, 10th July, 1661; Chamond Grenville,
1711. The Church Registers, as might be expected,
abound in references to the family. Their
descent, too, is given in the 'Heralds' Visitations'
for <em>Cornwall</em><a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> (p. 217); and Tuckett rightly omits
them from his edition of the 'Devonshire Pedigrees'
(p. 38, etc.). They commanded the <em>Cornish</em> forces
during the Civil War; and, from their earliest settlement
in the county, they intermarried with such old
Cornish families as Tregomynion, Trewent, Vivian,
Roscarrick, Killigrew, Arundell of Lanherne, Basset,
St. Aubyn, Bevill, Fortescue, Prideaux, and Tremayne.
That keen observer, the late Canon Kingsley,
has, moreover, not failed to detect, in the portrait of
the great Sir Richard, the thoroughly <em>Cornish</em> type
of face; and, finally, they are rightly included in the
'Bibliotheca Cornubiensis.' It is, in view of all
these facts, probably unnecessary to dwell any
further on the supremacy of Cornwall's claims to
the Grenvilles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
But it must be reluctantly confessed that they are,
after all, not of strictly Cornish origin; for, though
they lived for centuries in the county, they came in,
like the Bevills (with whom they intermarried more
than once), with the Conqueror; and, as an early
form of their name suggests<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> had their first home
in Normandy, and were descended from Duke Rollo,
and from Hamon Dentatus, Earl of Carboyle
(? Corbeil), and Lord of Thorigny and Granville in
that country. Their name has been variously spelt
Grenville, Greenville, Grenvile, Greenvil, Granville,
Grainvilla, Granaville, Greenvil and otherwise&mdash;it
even occurs in one place as Grinfillde;<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> but it seems
likely to be best known in history in the form prefixed
to this chapter, and which has been adopted
by the Poet Laureate in that stirring 'Ballad of the
Fleet,' with which we have all of us lately been
delighted, and to which we shall presently have
occasion to refer more fully.</p>

<p>Younger branches of the family settled in Bucks
and in Somerset, and preserved the favourite old
Christian name of Richard, which was also perpetuated
in the elder, or Cornish, branch: in fact it has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>been said that Cornwall was not without a Richard
Grenville for 200 consecutive years. Among the
earliest of them was one of the twelve knights amongst
whom the Conqueror partitioned Wales: he built the
monastery in South Wales, now known as Neath
Abbey, the ruins of which are a familiar and picturesque
object to the traveller by rail to Swansea.
In 1653, a Mr. John Nichols, of Hartland, had in his
possession 'a prophecy,' written in the year 1400,
said to have been found in Neath Abbey, and which
was kept in a curious box of jet. It referred to
the founder; and ran as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ix">'Amongst the trayne of valliant knights that with King William came,<br /></span>
<span class="ix">Grenvile is great, a Norman borne, renowned by his fame,<br /></span>
<span class="ix">His helmet <ins class="corr" title="Original text: 'rais d'">rais'd</ins> and first unlac'd upon the Cambrian shore,<br /></span>
<span class="ix">Where he, in honour to his God, this Abbey did decore<br /></span>
<span class="ix">With costly buildings, ornaments, and gave us spatious lands,<br /></span>
<span class="ix">As the first fruits which victory did give unto his hands.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the materials for the lives of the earlier Grenvilles
are too scanty for our present purpose; and&mdash;with
one exception&mdash;we must therefore be content
to dismiss them with the passing notice which has
already been accorded to the builder of Bideford
Bridge; and with a reference to one of the family,
William, who died in 1315, a distinguished statesman,
and forty-first Archbishop of York. He was
at Edward I.'s first Parliament at Carlisle; and,
according to some authorities, crowned Edward II.;
he also held several important councils at York relative
to the dissolution of the Order of the Temple.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>'William de Grenefild' (says Carew), 'from the
Deanery of Chichester stepped to the Chancellorship
of England, and Archbishoprick of York, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
King Edward the First. He was the son of Sir
Theobald Grenvill, of Stow, and Jane Trewent, and
was elected Archbishop of York in 1304, but not
confirmed till 1306, at Lions in France, by Pope
Clement the Fifth, who then held his Court in that
city, subsisting chiefly by the money which he got of
the Bishops for their confirmations. Of this Archbishop
he squeezed out within one year 9,500 marks,
besides his expenses whilst he lay there, which
made him so poor that when he returned into
England he was driven to gather money of the
clergy within his province at two sundry times in
one year; the first in the name of a benevolence,
and the second by way of an aid. He much
favoured the Templars, at that time oppresst by the
Pope, and Philip, King of France, though more
pitying them, says Fuller, as persons so stiffly
opposed by the said Potentates, that there was
more fear of his being suppressed by their foes,
than hope of their being supported by his friendship.
He was present in the Council of Vienna,
where that Order was abolished, and his place
assigned next to the Archbishop of Triers; which
was very high, as only beneath the lowest Elector,
and above Wurtzburg, or Herbipolis, and other
German prelates, who were also temporal Princes.
He died at Cawood (near Leeds, in Yorkshire),
1315, and was buried in the chapel of St. Nicholas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
(in York Cathedral), leaving the reputation of an able
statesman, and no ill scholar, behind him.' Tonkin
also, in his notes to the 'De Dunstanville' edition of
Carew, states, 'that the Archbishop was the son of
Sir Theobald Grenville, of Stow, and Jane Trewent.'</p>

<p>But Dixon, in his 'Fasti Eboracenses,' says, 'that
the birthplace and parentage of the Archbishop of
York are uncertain&mdash;notwithstanding that both
Carew and Fuller state that he was a Cornishman.
He was undoubtedly, however, connected with
several old and distinguished families, notably the
Giffards. Now Richard de Grenville, the founder of
the Grenville family, married a daughter of Walter
Giffard Earl of Bucks, temp. William I.' Dixon
speaks highly of the Archbishop's piety and zeal,
and says that he was a most excellent and painstaking
diocesan. As to the ruby ring removed from
the Archbishop's skeleton in 1735, and deposited in
the Treasury, Grotius says:</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>In Carew's 'Survey of Cornwall' (pp. 111, 112),
under Trematon Castle, is the following reference to
Sir Richard Grenville, Sheriff of Devon and Marshal
of Calais<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> (grandsire of the more celebrated Grenville
of that name), a man who 'enterlaced his
home magistracy with martiall employments abroad,'
and was a great favourite with bluff King Hal:</p>

<p>'At the last Cornish commotion Sir Richard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Greynuile the elder, with his Ladie and followers,
put themselves into this Castle, and there for awhile
indured the Rebels siege, incamped in three places
against it, who wanting great Ordinance, could
have wrought the besieged small scathe, had his
friends, or enemies, kept faith and promise: but
some of those within, slipping by night over the
wals, <em>with their bodies after their hearts</em>, and those
without, mingling humble intreatings with rude
menaces, he was hereby wonne, to issue forth at a
posterne gate for parley. The while, a part of those
rakehels, not knowing what honestie, and farre lesse,
how much the word of a souldier imported, stepped
betweene him and home, laid hold on his aged unweyldie
body and threatened to leaue it liuelesse, if
the inclosed did not leaue their resistance. So prosecuting
their first treacherie against the prince, with
suteable actions towards his subjects, they seized on
the Castle, and exercised the uttermost of their barbarous
crueltie (death excepted) on the surprised
prisoners. The seely (<em>i.e.</em> harmless) gentlewomen,
without regard of sexe or shame, were stripped from
their apparrell to their verie smockes, and some of
their fingers broken, to plucke away their rings,
&amp; Sir Richard himself made an exchange from
Trematon Castle, to that of Launceston, with the
Gayle to boote.'</p>

<p>Sir Richard, who married Matilda Bevill, died in
1550; and I have been fortunate enough to find two
of his poetical effusions&mdash;apparently in his own
handwriting, now very indistinct in places&mdash;amongst
the 'Additional MSS.' in the British Museum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
They appear to me to be well worth inserting, notwithstanding
their queer versification and grammar,
and their odd orthography:</p>

<p>The poetical Sir Richard's son Roger, a Captain
in the Navy, lost his life at the sinking of the
<i>Mary Rose</i> (commanded by Sir George Carew, a
Cornishman), at Spithead in 1545. 'Thus the ocean
became a bedde of honour,' as Carew says, 'to more
than one of the Grenvilles.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But it is time that we should turn to a greater
Sir Richard&mdash;the son of Roger Grenville and Thomasin
Cole of Slade.</p>

<p>My task will be on this occasion comparatively light;</p>

<p class="center small">'His praise is hymned by loftier harps than mine.'</p>

<p class="noind">The famous deeds of the great man to whom I
have now to call attention have been celebrated
by such writers as his kinsman Sir Walter Raleigh;
by Carew; by that master of portraiture Lord
Clarendon; by Charles Kingsley; and by Tennyson;
and I shall of course offer no apology for not
using any words of my own, where I can use theirs:
for, as Fuller said of the Ashburnhams, 'My poor
and plain pen, though willing, is unable to add any
lustre to this family of stupendous antiquity.'</p>

<p>Sir Richard, then, was born in 1540; and, when
only sixteen years of age, served in Hungary, under
the Emperor Maximilian, against the Turks, and was
present with Don John of Austria, at the battle of
Lepanto. He afterwards assisted in the reduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of Ireland; and, whilst there, filled the office of
Sheriff of Cork. When Sheriff of Cornwall in 1577,
he arrested Francis Tregian for harbouring Cuthbert
Mayne, a recusant priest (see <em>sub</em> 'The Arundells').
In 1571 he represented his native county in Parliament,
and was knighted. On 19th May, 1585, he
sailed from Plymouth with the first colonists, on a
voyage to the new-found land of Virginia, of which
voyage Thomas Hariot gave a 'Briefe and True
Report,' printed in 1588: on his homeward passage
he fell in with a Spanish ship of 300 tons, richly
laden, from St. Domingo, which he boarded on a raft,
his own boats being lost or disabled; and in 1586
he made a second visit to Virginia, pillaging the
towns of the Spaniards, and taking many prisoners.
With Raleigh he seems to have made one or two
similar expeditions, gathering much experience, if
not much pecuniary advantage.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>When the Spanish invasion was projected, Sir
Richard was, almost as a matter of course, elected
on the Council for the defence of the country, and
he received the Queen's special commands not to
quit Cornwall during the peril. On this occasion,
he is said to have provided '303 men at his own
cost, armed with 129 shot, 69 corsletts, and 179
bows.' Of the result there is no need to speak here;
but it has always been a matter of pride for West-country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
men to think how large a share in the
destruction of the Invincible Armada was performed
by the gallant sailors who quietly dropped out of
Plymouth Sound, and harassed their huge opponents
for days, till, what with shot, and storm, and tempest,
scarce one of the Spaniards was left to tell the tale
of their utter, and irretrievable defeat.</p>

<p>Kingsley has thus admirably described Sir Richard's
appearance:<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'The forehead and whole brain are of extraordinary
loftiness, and perfectly upright; the nose
long, aquiline, and delicately pointed; the mouth,
fringed with a short, silky beard, small and ripe, yet
firm as granite, with just pout enough of the lower
lip to give hint of that capacity of noble indignation
which lay hid under its usual courtly calm and sweetness;
if there be a defect in the face, it is that the
eyes are somewhat small, and close together, and the
eyebrows, though delicately arched, and without a
trace of peevishness, too closely pressed down upon
them; the complexion is dark, the figure tall and
graceful; altogether the likeness of a wise and
gallant gentleman, lovely to all good men, awful to all
bad men; in whose presence none dare say or do a
mean or a ribald thing; whom brave men left, feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
themselves nerved to do their duty better, while
cowards slipped away, as bats and owls before the
sun. So he lived and moved; whether in the Court
of Elizabeth, giving his counsel among the wisest;
or in the streets of Bideford, capped alike by squire
and merchant, shopkeeper and sailor; or riding along
the moorland roads between his houses of Stow and
Bideford, while every woman ran out to her door to
look at the great Sir Richard; or sitting in the low,
mullioned window at Burrough, with his cup of
malmsey before him, and the lute to which he had
just been singing laid across his knees, while the red
western sun streamed in upon his high, bland forehead
and soft curling locks; ever the same steadfast,
God-fearing, chivalrous man, conscious (as far as a
soul so healthy could be conscious) of the pride of
beauty, and strength, and valour, and wisdom, and
a race and name which claimed direct descent
from the grandfather of the Conqueror, and was
tracked down the centuries by valiant deeds and
noble benefits to his native shire, himself the noblest
of his race. Men said that he was proud&mdash;but he
could not look round him without having something
to be proud of; that he was stern and harsh to his
sailors&mdash;but it was only when he saw in them any
taint of cowardice or falsehood; that he was subject,
at moments, to such fearful fits of rage, that he had
been seen to snatch glasses from the table, grind
them to pieces in his teeth, and swallow them&mdash;but
that was only when his indignation had been
aroused by some tale of cruelty and oppression;
and, above all, by those West Indian devilries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the Spaniards, whom he regarded (and in those

<p>'Old Stow House stands,' says he, 'or rather stood,
some four miles within the Cornish border, on the
northern slope of the largest and loveliest of those
coombes'&mdash;which he had just been describing in a
memorable passage of a preceding chapter (the sixth)
in 'Westward Ho!' 'Eighty years <em>after</em> Sir Richard's
time there arose a huge Palladian pile, bedizened
with every monstrosity of bad taste, which was
built, so the story runs, by Charles II. for Sir
Richard's great-grandson, the heir of that famous
Sir Bevil who defeated the Parliamentary troops at
Stratton, and died soon after, fighting valiantly at
Lansdowne over Bath. But like most other things
which owed their existence to the Stuarts, it rose
only to fall again. An old man who had seen, as
a boy, the foundation of the new house laid, lived
to see it pulled down again, and the very bricks
and timber sold upon the spot; and since then the
stables have become a farmhouse, the tennis-court a
sheep-cote, the great quadrangle a rick-yard; and
civilization, spreading wave on wave so fast elsewhere,
has surged back from that lonely corner of
the land&mdash;let us hope only for awhile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>

<p>'But I am not writing of that great <em>new</em> Stow
House, of the past glories whereof quaint pictures
still hang in the neighbouring houses;  ... I have
to deal with a simpler age, and a sterner generation;
and with the <em>old</em> house, which had stood there,
in part at least, from grey and mythic ages  ... a
huge, rambling building, half-castle, half-dwelling-house....
On three sides, to the north, west and
south, the lofty walls of the old ballium still stood,
with their machicolated turrets, loopholes, and dark
downward crannies for dropping stones and fire on
the besiegers;  ... but the southern court of the
ballium had become a flower-garden, with quaint
terraces, statues, knots of flowers, clipped yews and
hollies, and all the pedantries of the topiarian art.
And, towards the east, where the vista of the valley
opened, the old walls were gone, and the frowning
Norman keep, ruined in the wars of the Roses, had
been replaced by the rich and stately architecture of
the Tudors. Altogether, the house, like the time,
was in a transitionary state, and represented faithfully
enough the passage of the old middle age into
the new life which had just burst into blossom
throughout Europe, never, let us pray, to see its
autumn or its winter.</p>

<p>'From the house on three sides the hills sloped
steeply down, and from the garden there was a truly
English prospect. At one turn they could catch,
over the western walls, a glimpse of the blue ocean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
flecked with passing sails; and at the next, spread
far below, range on range of fertile park, stately
avenue, yellow autumn woodland, and purple heather
moors, lapping over and over each other up the
valley to the old British earthwork, which stood
black and furze-grown on its conical peak; and,
standing out against the sky, on the highest bank of
the hill which closed the valley to the east, the lofty
tower of Kilkhampton Church, rich with the monuments
and offerings of five centuries of Grenvilles.'</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Such were old Stow, and its gallant owner Sir
Richard. And the women of the Grenville home
seem, for the most part, to have been as fair and
virtuous and accomplished as their husbands were
sagacious and brave. Polwhele, in after-times, particularly
noticed the remarkable beauty of Sir Richard's
great-great-granddaughter Mary, the daughter of the
Honourable Bernard Grenville, of Stow. Sir Richard
married Mary, the daughter of Sir John St. Leger;
but the lovely dame had, like the wife of her illustrious
grandson, Sir Bevill, to give up what was
dearest to her in the world, to the cruel necessities
of the troubled times in which they lived.</p>

<p>Yet I cannot doubt that these women had the
spirits of Roman matrons within them; and would
have assented to Lovelace's lines had their husbands
whispered the couplet to them:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'I could not love thee, dear, so much<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Lov'd I not honour more.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>To return to Sir Richard:&mdash;In 1591 we find him
acting as Vice-Admiral of a squadron sent out to
intercept the richly-laden Spanish fleet on its return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
from the West Indies; a service of the utmost
importance, as, in capturing or sinking the Indian
supplies, observes Mr. Arber, England 'stopped the
sources of Philip's power to hurt herself.' How the
English ships were surprised in their lurking-place
'at Flores<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> in the Azores,' and how valiantly Sir
Richard Grenville fought and died for Queen and
country, let Raleigh and Tennyson tell.</p>

<p>It was towards the end of August, whilst the Admiral,
Lord Thomas Howard,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> with six of her
Majesty's ships and a few smaller vessels and pinnaces,
was at anchor at Flores, when news suddenly
came of the near approach of the great Spanish fleet.
Many of the Englishmen were ill on shore, while
others were filling the ships with ballast, or collecting
water. Imperfectly manned and ballasted as
they were, there was nothing for it&mdash;at least so Lord
Howard appears to have thought&mdash;in the face of so
enormously preponderating a force as they found was
close at hand, but to weigh anchor, and escape as they
best could: and so it became a complete <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sauve qui peut</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>some of the ships were even compelled to slip their
cables. Sir Richard, as Vice-Admiral, was the last
to start, delaying to do so till the final moment, in
order to collect several of his sick crew who were on
the island, and who, if he had left them there, must
have been lost. This noble delay of his resulted in
the safety of the remainder of the fleet; but it cost
Sir Richard and his crew their lives; and the little
<i>Revenge</i>, which had four or five times narrowly escaped
shipwreck, her existence: but she was, as Admiral
Hawkins described her, 'ever a ship loaden, and full
fraught with ill successe.' Grenville refused to 'cut
his mainsail, and cast about,' and so run from the
enemy; but persuaded his crew that he would contrive
to pass through the two great Spanish squadrons
which intercepted him, 'in despight of them, and
would enforce those of Sivil to give him way.' It
was the story of the 300 Spartans at Thermopyl√¶
acted over again. The huge <i>San Philip</i> of 1,500
tons (carrying 'three tier of ordinance on a side, and
eleven pieces on every tier; she shot eight forth
right out of her chase, besides those of her stern
ports'), however, loomed to windward of the small
English ship; and 'becalmed his sails in such sort as
the <i>Revenge</i> could neither make way, nor feel the
helm;' and then&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ix">'Sir Richard spoke and he laughed, and we roared a hurrah, and so<br /></span>
<span class="ix">The little <i>Revenge</i> ran on sheer into the heart of the foe,<br /></span>
<span class="ix">With her hundred fighters on deck, and her ninety sick below;<br /></span>
<span class="ix">For half of their fleet to the right, and half to the left were seen,<br /></span>
<span class="ix">And the little <i>Revenge</i> ran on thro' the long sea lane between.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">What end could there be, but one, to courage so
chivalric, so desperate, and so devoted as this?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
'After the <i>Revenge</i> was entangled with this <i>Philip</i>,'
says Raleigh, 'four other boarded her&mdash;(<em>i.e.</em>, laid her
aboard)&mdash;two on her larboard, and two on her starboard.
The fight thus beginning at three o'clock in the
afternoon, continued very terrible all that evening.
But the great <i>San Philip</i> having received the lower
tier of the <i>Revenge</i>, discharged with cross-bar shot,
shifted herself with all diligence from her sides,
utterly misliking her first entertainment. Some
say that the ship foundered, but we cannot report
for truth, unless we are assured. The Spanish
ships were filled with companies of soldiers, in some
two hundred, beside the mariners; in some five, in
others eight, hundred. In ours there were none at
all besides the mariners, but the servants of the
commanders, and some few voluntary gentlemen
only. After many interchanged vollies of great
ordnance and small shot, the Spaniards deliberated
to enter the <i>Revenge</i>, and made divers attempts,
hoping to force her, by the multitudes of their armed
soldiers and musketeers, but were still repulsed
again and again, and at all times beaten back into
their own ships, or into the seas.'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ix">'And the rest they came aboard us, and they fought us hand to hand,<br /></span>
<span class="ix">For a dozen times they came with their pikes and musqueteers,<br /></span>
<span class="ix">And a dozen times we shook 'em off, as a dog that shakes his ears<br /></span>
<span class="ix">When he leaps from the water to the land.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'In the beginning of the fight,' Sir Walter Raleigh
continues, 'the <i>George Noble</i>, of London, having
received some shot through her, by the armadas,
fell under the lee of the <i>Revenge</i>, and asked Sir
Richard what he would command him, being but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
one of the victuallers, and of small force; Sir
Richard bade him save himself, and leave him to
his fortune. After the fight had thus, without intermission,
continued while the day lasted, and some
hours of the night, many of our men were slain and
hurt, and one of the great gallions of the armada,
and the admiral of the hulks both sunk, and in many
other of the Spanish ships great slaughter was
made.'</p>

<p>The marvel is how a fragment of the brave little
craft was still afloat, for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ix">'Ship after ship the whole night long, their high-built galleons came,<br /></span>
<span class="ix">Ship after ship, the whole night long, with their battle-thunder and flame,<br /></span>
<span class="ix">Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead and her shame.<br /></span>
<span class="ix">For some were sunk, and some were shattered, and some could fight us no more&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="ix">God of battles! was ever a battle like this in the world before?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'Some write,' says Raleigh, 'that Sir Richard
was very dangerously hurt almost in the beginning
of the fight, and lay speechless for a time before he
recovered. But two of the <i>Revenge's</i> own company
brought home in a ship of Lime (Lyme Regis)
from the islands, examined by some of the lords and
others, affirm that he was never so wounded as that
he forsook the upper deck, till an hour before midnight;
and then being shot into the body with a
musket as he was a dressing, was again shot into
the head, and withal his chururgion wounded to
death. This agreeth also with an examination
taken by Sir Francis Godolphin,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> of four other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
mariners of the same ship being returned, which
examination the said Sir Francis sent unto Master
William Killegrue,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> of Her Majesty's Privy Chamber.'</p>

<p>But to return to the fight; 'the Spanish ships
which attempted to board the <i>Revenge</i>, as they were
wounded and beaten off, so always others came in
their places, she having never less than two mighty
gallions by her sides, and aboard her: so that ere
the morning, from three of the clock of the day
before, <em>there had been fifteen several armadas assailed
her; and all so ill-approved their entertainment, as they
were by the break of day far more willing to hearken to
a composition than hastily to make any more assaults or
entries</em>. But as the day encreased, so our men
decreased; and as the light grew more and more,
by so much more grew our discomforts; for none
appeared in sight but enemies, saving one small ship
called the <i>Pilgrim</i>, commanded by Jacob Whiddon,
who hovered all night to see the success; but in the
morning bearing with the <i>Revenge</i>, was hunted like a
hare amongst many ravenous hounds, but escaped.</p>

<p>'All the powder of the <i>Revenge</i> to the last barrel
was now spent, all her pikes broken, forty of her
best men slain, and the most part of the rest hurt.
In the beginning of the fight she had but one
hundred free from sickness, and four score and ten
sick, laid in hold upon the ballast. A small troop to
man such a ship, and a weak garrison to resist so
mighty an army. By those hundred all was sustained,
the vollies, boardings, and enterings of fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
ships of war, besides those which beat her at large
(<em>i.e.</em>, from a little distance off). On the contrary,
the Spaniards were always supplied with soldiers
brought from every squadron; all manner of arms
and powder at will. Unto ours there remained no
comfort at all, no hope, no supply either of ships,
men, or weapons; the masts all beaten overboard,
all her tackle cut asunder, her upper work altogether
razed, and in effect evened she was with the water,
but the very foundation of a ship, nothing being left
overhead either for flight or defence.' Mr. O. W.
Brierly's recently engraved picture of this stage of
the fight, showing the little <i>Revenge</i> with her mainsail
down and lying over her 'like a pall,' surrounded by
her over-towering enemies, still afraid to approach
the dangerous little barque, gives a vivid, and
probably accurate idea of the tremendous odds
against which the devoted Englishmen had to
contend.</p>

<p>'Sir Richard, finding himself in this distress, and
unable any longer to make resistance, having endured,
in this fifteen hours' fight, the assault of
fifteen different armadas, all by turns aboard him,
and by estimation eight hundred shot of great
artillery, besides many assaults and entries; and
that the ship and himself must needs be possessed
of the enemy, who were now all cast in a ring round
about him, now gave the order to destroy his gallant
craft:</p>

<p>To this <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="daimoni√™ aret√™">Œ¥Œ±ŒπŒºŒøŒΩ·Ω∑Œ∑ ·ºÄœÅŒµœÑ·Ω¥</span> (as Froude calls it) of the
fiery Sir Richard the master-gunner readily assented;
but, according to Raleigh's account, the
captain and master pointed out that the Spaniards
would doubtless give them good terms, and that
there were still some valiant men left on board their
little ship whose lives might hereafter be of service
to England. Sir Richard was probably by this time
too weak and wounded to contest the matter further;
the counsels of the captain and master prevailed;
and the master actually succeeded in obtaining for
conditions <em>that all their lives should be saved, the
crew sent to England, and the officers ransomed</em>. In
vain did the master-gunner protest and even attempt
to commit suicide: Tennyson has summed up the
story in one sad line:</p>

<p class="center small">
'And the lion lay there dying, and they yielded to the foe.'<br />
</p>

<p>Sir Richard was now removed to the ship of the
Spanish admiral, 'the <i>Revenge</i> being marvellous unsavoury,
filled with blood and bodies of dead and
wounded men like a slaughter-house.'</p>

<p>And now&mdash;</p>

<p class="center small">
'How died he? Death to life is crown, or shame&mdash;'<br />
</p>

<p>There, on the deck of Don Alfonso Bassano's
ship, in the midst of the Spanish captains, who
crowded round to wonder at the man who had so
long defied their deadly attacks, two or three days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
after the fight between 'the mastiffs of England and
the bloodhounds of Spain,' the grand old Cornish
warrior's spirit left the body, speaking his last words
thus&mdash;in Spanish, so John Huighen van Linschoten
(in 'Hakluyt's Voyages') tells us:</p>

<p>'Here die I, Richard Grenville, with a joyful and
quiet mind; for that I have ended my life as a true
soldier ought to do, fighting for his Country, Queen,
Religion and Honour: my soul willingly departing
from this body, leaving behind the lasting fame of
having behaved as every valiant soldier is in duty
bound to do.'</p>

<p>Lord Bacon says of the fight that it was 'Memorable
euen beyond credit, and to the Height of
some Heroicall Fable.'</p>

<p>And well might Ruskin, in his 'Bibliotheca Pastorum'
(i. 33), class the Cornish hero with Arnold of
Sempach, Leonidas and Curtius as a type of 'the
divinest of sacrifices&mdash;that of the patriot for his country'!
Well might the gentle Evelyn exclaim: 'Than
this what have we more? What can be greater?'
And well might gallant old Sir John Hawkins wish
that this story might be 'written in our Chronicles,'&mdash;as
it has been, by Raleigh and by Tennyson,&mdash;in
'letters of Gold.'</p>

<p>The Spanish fleet were not permitted to enjoy the
fruits of this, their hard-earned and almost only capture
during the war; for, a few days after the battle,
a great storm arose from the west and north-west,
dispersing their battle-ships, and also the West
Indian fleet (the cause of the English Expedition)
which had now joined them; and sinking, off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
coast of St. Michael, fourteen sail, together with the
<i>Revenge</i>&mdash;which seemed to disdain to survive her
commander&mdash;with 200 Spaniards on board her.</p>

<p>'So it pleased them,' says Raleigh, 'to honour the
burial of that renowned ship the <i>Revenge</i>, not suffering
her to perish alone, for the great honour she
achieved in her life-time.' A noble elegy! which
even Tennyson's genius has been unable to surpass.</p>

<p>This is not perhaps the time or the place to consider
how it was possible for this one little English
vessel with a crew of 100 men, to contend so long
against 50 (or according to some accounts 53) Spanish
galleons with 10,000 men, sinking four of the largest,
and slaying 1,000 Spaniards; but it was no doubt
owing to more causes than one:&mdash;to the low and short
hull, which made her more manageable&mdash;to superior
gunnery and seamanship&mdash;but mainly to the stoutest,
freest, and fiercest <em>hearts</em> upon earth&mdash;the hearts of
Englishmen. They <em>believed</em> they were more than a
match for their foes, and confidence begat victory;
and if ever there was an English victory, in the
fullest sense of the word, it was the triumphant loss
of the '<i>Revenge</i>.'</p>

<p>The Spanish proverb ran</p>

<p lang="es" xml:lang="es" class="center small">
'Guerra con todo il mondo;&mdash;y paz con Inghilterra;'<br />
</p>

<p class="noind">and it has well been said that the episode of the <i>Revenge</i>
dealt a deadlier blow to the fame and moral
strength of Spain, than even the defeat of the Armada
itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
But Sir Richard was not left without a witness.
Passing over his son John, who, Carew says, followed
Raleigh, and was drowned in the ocean, which
'became his bedde of honour;' and also another son
Sir Bernard, who died in 1605, after having served as
Sheriff of Cornwall and M.P. for Bodmin&mdash;as not being
of such transcendent merit as either Sir Bernard's
father or son&mdash;we come to the 'immortal' Sir Bevill
Grenville, eldest son of the said Sir Bernard and his
wife Elizabeth Beville of Killigarth near Polperro&mdash;(or,
according to another account, of Brinn)&mdash;a man
no whit inferior in loyalty and courage to his illustrious
grandsire.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sir Bevill was born, somewhat unexpectedly, on
23rd March, 1595, at Brinn&mdash;probably Great Brinn,
the seat of the Bevills, but not a stone of the old
mansion is now standing&mdash;in the little Cornish parish
of Withiel; four years after the little <i>Revenge</i> went
down by the island crags,</p>

<p class="center small">
'To be lost evermore in the main.'<br />
</p>

<p>He was doubtless carefully brought up at Stow&mdash;the
<em>old</em> Stow&mdash;which was in those days a sort of nursery for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the better sort of young Cornishmen. The late Rev.
R. S. Hawker, vicar of Morwenstow, has given us the
following pleasant picture of it in Sir Bevill's days:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'On the brow of a lofty hill,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> crested with stag-horned
trees, commanding a deep and woodland
gorge wherein "the Crooks of Combe" (the curves
of a winding river) urge onward to the "Severn
Sea," still survive the remains of famous old Stow,
that historic abode of the loyal and glorious Sir
Bevill, the Bayard of old Cornwall, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans peur et
sans reproche</span>," in the thrilling Stewart wars. No
mansion on the Tamar-side ever accumulated so
rich and varied a store of association and event.
Thither the sons of the Cornish gentry were accustomed
to resort, to be nurtured and brought up with
the children of Sir Bevill Grenville and Lady
Grace; for the noble knight was literally the "glass
wherein" the youth of those ancient times "did
dress themselves." There their graver studies were
relieved by manly pastimes and athletic exercise.
Like the children of the Persians, they were taught
"to ride, to bend the bow, and to speak the truth."
At hearth and hall every time-honoured usage and
festive celebration was carefully and reverently preserved.
Around the walls branched the massive
antlers of the red deer of the moors, the trophies of
many a bold achievement with horse and hound.
At the buttery-hatch hung a tankard, marked with
the guest's and the traveller's peg, and a manchet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
flanked with native cheese, stood ready on a trencher
for any sudden visitant who might choose to lift the
latch; for the Grenville motto was, "An open door
and a greeting hand." A troop of retainers, servants,
grooms, and varlets of the yard, stood each
in his place, and under orders to receive with a
welcome the unknown stranger, as well as their
master's kinsman or friend.'</p></div>

<p>From Stow Bevill Grenville went to the famous old
West-country college, Exeter College, Oxford; where
he was placed under Dr. Prideaux (one, I fancy, of
the worthy family of Prideaux Place, Padstow). He
shortly afterwards entered Parliament, and going to
Scotland, in command of a troop of horse, with the
King, was knighted.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The relations of Sir Bevill and Clarendon were
peculiar. Clarendon had quarrelled with Sir Bevill's
fiery brother, Sir Richard (created, according to
Whitelocke, Baron of Lostwithiel in 1644), a man of
high spirit and of considerable bravery and military
skill, but with an unlucky facility for getting into
scrapes and troubles of all sorts. He begins with a
squabble with his wife's brother-in-law, the powerful
Earl of Suffolk, which ends in Sir Richard's having
to pay a fine of ¬£8,000, besides undergoing sixteen
months' imprisonment in the Fleet. He afterwards
served in Ireland, and on his return to England,
finding it a matter of considerable difficulty to get
his arrears of pay, resorted to the following questionable
artifice for the purpose. He pretended to lend
a not unwilling ear to the Parliament's suggestion,
that in return for being paid the money due to him,
he should transfer his sword from the King's cause
to theirs. Indeed, he even went so far as to take the
command of a body of Roundhead horse, and marched
upon Basing. But on reaching Hounslow he, without
much difficulty, persuaded all his officers and
men to proceed to Oxford instead, where he placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the services of his whole party at the King's disposal,
whereupon the Parliamentarians righteously
enough dubbed him 'skellum' (scoundrel) and
'renegado.' He did yeoman's service for the King
in Cornwall, and Charles left the blockade of
Plymouth in his charge&mdash;a blockade which, as we
know, was finally abandoned. The whole story is
given in Llewellyn Jewitt's 'History of Plymouth,'
together with a scornful letter to Sir Richard from
the defenders. And I notice that in a letter from
Sir R. Grenville to his nephew, the Earl of Bath,
then only about sixteen years old, he is reported to
have said, 'We have here made a stand with our
forces and the garrisons of Salt Ash, Milbrooke and
others considerable have come up and added to our
former, and we hope well.' The letter is dated
'Truro, 29 July, 1644.'</p>

<p>There appears to have been no sufficient reason
why he should have been asked to surrender his post
of 'the King's General in the West'<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> in favour of
Lord Hopton, but he was compelled to do so; and
on giving up his command he refused to serve under
that officer, upon which he was forthwith 'clapped
up' in Launceston Gaol, to the great dissatisfaction
of many of the Cornish officers and soldiers, who
attributed their ultimate discomfiture to the absence
of Sir Richard from the field.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>Clarendon (his foe), and the prejudiced and inaccurate
Echard, give very unflattering accounts of
Sir Richard; but his grand-nephew, George Lord
Lansdowne, published a skilful and temperate vindication
of him against their aspersions; and Sir
Richard printed his own 'Defence' in Holland, dating
it 28th January, 1654. Whilst in Holland, by the way,
he seems to have attempted reprisals upon the Earl
of Suffolk; for we find that one of Milton's Latin
'State Letters' is addressed to the Archduke Leopold
of Austria, Governor of the Spanish Netherlands
<ins class="corr" title="Original text: 'undated)'">(undated)</ins>, to the effect that Sir Charles Harbord, an
Englishman, has had certain goods and household
stuff violently seized at Bruges by Sir Richard Grenville.
The goods had originally been sent from
England to Holland in 1643 by the then Earl of
Suffolk, in pledge for a debt owing to Harbord; and
Grenville's pretext was that he also was a creditor of
the Earl, and had obtained a decree of the English
Chancery in his favour. Now, by the English law,
neither was the present Earl of Suffolk bound by that
decree, nor could the goods be distrained under it.
The decision of the Court to that effect was transmitted,
and his Serenity was requested to cause
Grenville to restore the goods, inasmuch as it was
against the comity of nations that anyone should be
allowed an action in foreign jurisdiction which he
would not be allowed in the country where the cause
of the action first arose. The letter ends thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'The justice of the case itself and the universal
reputation of your Serenity for fair dealing have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
moved us to commend the matter to your attention;
and, if at any time there shall be occasion to discuss
the rights or convenience of your subjects with
us, I promise that you shall find our diligence in
the same not remiss, but at all times most ready.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Clarendon and Sir Richard both went into exile,
and more than once hurled reproaches at each other;
but the crowning misfortune of Grenville's life was the
refusal of Charles II., on Sir Richard's failing to
justify some statements which he had made against
Lord Clarendon, to let him appear at Court. This
broke the old man's heart. He let his beard grow
from that time; and died soon afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Hals, delighting, as usual, to say anything sour and
disagreeable of his fellow-countymen, states in his
MSS. that when Sir Richard, at the death of
Charles I., 'for safe gaurd of his life fled beyond the
seas,' he passed most of his time 'in france and
Itally, sufferinge greate wants and necessities,' and
'was at Length comparitively starved to Death....
His son Richard Grenvill, in the Interregnum of
Cromwell, was executed at Tyburne for robbinge
Passengers on the high way to Relieve his necessity.
Moreover Sir Thomas Grenvill Kt. at the same
tyme was Driven to such Extreame wants in his
owne Country that he was forced for Reliefe to
begge the Charity of his friends and Dyed in Great
want and penury&mdash;and his Lady also&mdash;though his
Daughter Jane, being a Servant to the Lady Robarts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
was marryed to John Tregagle Gent. from whom
the Tregagles of Treworder are Descended.'</p>

<p>Here is, perhaps, a convenient place to add that
Polwhele thought that Henry Grenfield, Master of
the Truro Grammar School in 1685, was one of
this family. He wrote a charming 'Hymnus Vespertinus,'
which is preserved in R. N. Worth's 'West
Country Garland.'</p>

<p>A writer in <cite>Notes and Queries</cite> (5th Series, X. Sept.
14th, 1878) observes that, 'It is curious that, whereas
the name of Grenville, as one of distinction, has
long died out in Cornwall, it appeared suddenly in
the registers of Fowey about a hundred years ago,
the persons bearing it being in humble circumstances.
As this is the only trace of the family
name remaining in Cornwall or Devonshire, counties
with which it was so intimately connected in local
history, the matter may be of interest. There
would, in fact, seem to be some mystery enveloping
the extinction of the name, which is at the
present moment borne <em>by right of birth</em> by very few
persons, although some six creations of the title
have been made to keep it in the peerage. Gilbert
is believed to have entertained an opinion that the
family still existed <em>in the direct line</em> in Cornwall or
Devonshire, and had sunk out of sight by reason of
poverty, when the never very flourishing condition
of the Grenvilles became untenable. The Carterets,
Thynnes, and Leveson-Gowers now jointly and
severally represent the old family, but only indirectly,
and solely in the line which Sir Bevill Grenville
ennobled.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>But Clarendon, though he had quarrelled so
utterly with Sir Richard, had nothing but good
to say of 'the most generally beloved man of the
county of Cornwall,' his brother, Sir Bevill<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
&mdash;'<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sans peur et sans reproche</span>'&mdash;of his mild and conciliatory
character, his indefatigable activity, and his ardent
courage&mdash;qualities which rendered him an invaluable
adherent of the first Charles during the unnatural
struggles of the Civil War&mdash;'the war without an
enemy'&mdash;the black cloud' which was to overspreade
the whole kingdome, and cast all into disorder and
darknesse.'</p>

<p>It will be within the memory of all readers of the
noble historian that the King's cause suffered very
much, from the first, from the superior promptitude of
the Parliamentary leaders, who had actually appointed
Militia Committees in the various counties&mdash;Cornwall
included&mdash;long before the King's standard was raised.
But the Cornish gentry, headed by our Sir Bevill,
who had already in 1638 raised a troop of horse to
serve with Charles against the Scots, were conspicuous
for their loyalty, to which Charles's memorable
letter of thanks from Sudeley Castle, 10th September,
1643 (copies of which still hang in many of the
Cornish churches as commanded by the King) amply
testifies. And at first Sir Bevill, 'the Mirror of
Chivalry,' as he was called in the West, was more
than a match for the Committees, which he speedily
suppressed; and at once, with the assistance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Trevanion, Arundell, Basset, Godolphin, and others,
set to work to raise a regular force.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>At this juncture, the following sweet and gallant
letter, which Eliot Warburton quotes as an example
of the romantic loyalty of the day, in his 'Memoirs
of Prince Rupert and the Cavaliers,' was addressed
to Sir John Trelawny, the first baronet of that name&mdash;evidently
in reply to a communication from Sir
John urging the Knight of Stow not to embark in
so perilous an enterprise:</p>

<p class="p1-5">
'<span class="smcap">Most Honourable Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I have in many kinds had trial of your
nobleness, but in none more than in this singular
expression of your kind care and love. I give also
your excellent Lady humble thanks for respect unto
my poor Woman, who hath been long a faithful
much obliged servant of your Ladyes. But, Sir, for
my journey, it is fixed. I cannot contain myself
within my doors, when the King of England's standard
waves in the field upon so just occasion. The
cause being such as must make all those that die in
it little inferior to martyrs. And for my own part,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
I desire to acquire an honest name or an honourable
grave. I never loved my life or ease so much as to
shun such an occasion; which if I should, I were
unworthy of the profession I have held, or to succeed
those ancestors of mine, who have so many of them
in several ages sacrificed their lives for their country.</p>

<p>'Sir, the barborous and implacable enemy, notwithstanding
His Majesty's gracious proceedings
with them, do continue their insolencies and rebellion
in the highest degree, and are united in a body of
great strength; so, as you may expect, if they be not
prevented and mastered near their own homes, they
will be troublesome in yours, and in the remotest
places ere long.</p>

<p>'I am not without the consideration, as you
lovingly advise, of my wife and family; and as for
her, I must acknowledge, she hath ever drawn so
evenly in the yoke with me, as she hath never prest
before, or hung behind me, nor ever opposed or
resisted my will. And yet truly, I have not, in this
or anything else, endeavoured to walk in any way of
power with her, but of reason; and though her love
will submit to either, yet truly my respect will not
suffer me to urge her with power unless I can convince
with reason. So much for that, whereof I am
willing to be accomptable unto so good a friend.</p>

<p>'I have no suit unto you in mine own behalf, but
for your prayers and good wishes; and that if I live
to come home again, you would please to continue
me in the number of your servants.</p>

<p>'I shall give a true relation unto my very noble

to him, which he hath good reason to be
thankful for. And so, I beseech God to send you
and your noble family all health and happiness, and

<p>Writing to his 'Deare love' and 'best friend,' from
Bodmin on the 12th October, he says: 'My neighbours
did ill that came not out, and are punishable by
the law in high degree; and although I will do the
best I can to save some of the honester sort, yet
others shall smart.' Nevertheless he was a staunch
friend of Sir John Eliot (who was godfather to one of
his children), and was mainly instrumental in procuring
Sir John's release from the Tower. Forster
quotes many of Sir Bevill's letters, in his 'Life of
Eliot,' all of which are in the highest degree noble,
patriotic, and affectionate. But by far the most
charming are the following delightful letters to his
graceful, affectionate, and accomplished wife:<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Then comes the account of the victory over the
Parliamentary forces on Braddock Down, half-way
between Lostwithiel and Liskeard:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'<span class="smcap">My deare Love</span>,<br /></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'It hath pleas'd God to give us a happie
victory this present Thursday being ye 19th of
Jan<sup>y</sup>, for which pray join with me in giving God
thanks. We advanced yesterday from Bodmin to
find ye enemy which we heard was abroad, or if we
miss'd him in the field we were resolved to unhouse
them in Liskeard or leave our boddies in the highway.
We were not above 3 miles from Bodmin,
when we had view of two troops of their horse to
whom we sent some of ours, which chased them out
of the field while our foot march'd after our horse;
but night coming on we could march no further
than Boconnocke Parke,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> where (upon my co.
Mohun's kind notion) we quartered all our army by
good fires under the hedge. The next morning (being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
this day) we marched forth, and about noone came
in full view of the enemies whole army upon a fair
heath between Boconnocke and Braddocke Church.
They were in horse much stronger than we, but in
foot we were superior, as I thinke. They were
possest of a pretty rising ground which was in the
way towards Liskeard and we planted ourselves
upon such another against them with in muskett
shot, and we saluted each other with bulletts about
two hours or more, each side being willing to keep
their ground and to have the other to come over
to his prejudice; but after so long delay, they standing
still firm, and being obstinate to hould their
advantage, Sir Ra. Hopton resolved to march over
to them, and to leave all to the mercy of God and
valour of our side. I had the Van; so after solemne
prayers in the head of every division,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> I led my part
away, who followed me with so good courage both
down one hill and up the other, as it strooke a terror
in them, while the seconds came up gallantly after
me, and the wings of horse charged on both sides,
but their courage so failed them as they stood not
our first charge of the foot, but fled in great disorder
and we chast them divers miles; many were not
slain because of their quick disordering, but we have
taken above 600 prisoners among which S<sup>r</sup> Shilston
Calmady is one, and more are still brought in by the
soldiers; much armes they have lost, and colours we
have won, and 4 pieces of ordinance from them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and without rest we marched to Liskeard, and tooke
it without delay, all their men flying from it before
we came, and so I hope we are now againe in ye way
to settle the country in peace. All our Cornish
Grandies were present at the battell with the Scotch
Generall Ruthen, the Somersett Collonels and the
horse Captains Pim and Tomson, and but for their
horses' speed had been all in our hands; let my
sister and my cossens of Clovelly, with ye other
friends, understande of God's mercy to us, and we
lost not a man. So I rest</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>As a result of the battle, Saltash was now relieved,
many prisoners, guns, and a frigate were taken there,
and the Parliamentary leaders were reduced to propose
(ineffectually, however) the neutrality of Cornwall
and Devon in the conflict. We next hear of Sir
Bevill's being, in conjunction with Sir Ralph Hopton,
after a sudden and forced march from Plymouth,
attacked at Launceston; but the Cornish forces
repulsed their assailants and drove them back
into Devonshire. Such was the reputation of this
gallant little force that it was now determined to
send an army of 7,000 men against them, and the
battle of Stratton, almost within sight of the old
Grenville seat at Stow, ensued; in which the Parliamentarians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
though two to one, were again defeated.
Sir Bevill once more led the van of the King's army;
and Clarendon thus describes the engagement in language
so vivid, that we almost see the cavaliers as
they dashed, all plumed and crimson-scarfed, through
fields of blood:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ix">'Then "Spur and sword!" was the battle-word, and we made their helmets ring,<br /></span>
<span class="ix">Shouting like madmen all the while, "For God and for the King!"<br /></span>
<span class="ix">And, though they snuffled psalms, to give the rebel dogs their due,<br /></span>
<span class="ix">When the roaring shot poured thick and hot they were stalwart men and true.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus Clarendon:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'In this manner the fight begun: the King's
forces pressing, with their utmost vigour, up the
hill, and the enemies as obstinately defending their
ground. The fight continued with very doubtful
success, till towards three of the clock in the afternoon;
when word was brought to the chief officers
of the Cornish that their ammunition was spent to
less than four barrels of powder; which (concealing
the defect from the soldiers) they resolved could
only be supplied with courage; and therefore, by
messengers to one another, they agreed to advance
with their full bodies, without making any more
shot, till they reached the top of the hill, and so
might be upon even ground with the enemy;
wherein the officers' courage and resolution was so
well seconded by the soldiers, that they begun to get
ground in all places; and the enemy, in wonder of
the men, who out-faced their shot with their swords,
to quit their post. Major-General Chudlegh, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
ordered the battle, failed in no part of a soldier;
and when he saw his men recoil from less numbers,
and the enemy in all places gaining the hill upon
him, himself advanced, with a good stand of pikes,
upon that party which was led by Sir John Berkley
and Sir Bevil Grenville, and charged them so
smartly that he put them into disorder; Sir Bevil
Grenville in the shock being borne to the ground,
but, quickly relieved by his companion, they so
re-inforced the charge that having killed most of the
assailants, and dispersed the rest, they took the
Major-General prisoner, after he had behaved himself
with as much courage as a man could do. Then
the enemy gave ground apace, inasmuch as the four
parties, growing nearer and nearer as they ascended
the hill, between three and four of the clock, they all
met together upon one ground near the top of the
hill, where they embraced with unspeakable joy,
each congratulating the other's success, and all
acknowledging the wonderful blessing of God; and
being there possessed of some of the enemy's
cannon, they turned them upon the camp, and
advanced together to the perfect victory. But the
enemy no sooner understood the loss of their Major-General
but their hearts failed them; and being so
resolutely pressed, and their ground lost, upon the
security and advantage whereof they wholly depended,
some of them threw down their arms, and
others fled, dispersing themselves, and every man
shifting for himself.</p>

<p>'This victory,' pursues the historian, 'was in
substance, as well as circumstance, as signal a one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
as hath happened to either party since the unhappy
distraction; for on the King's party were not lost in
all above four score men, whereof few were officers,
and none above the degree of a captain; and though
many more were hurt, not above ten men died
afterwards of their wounds. On the Parliament side,
notwithstanding their advantage of ground, and that
the other were the assailants, above three hundred
were slain on the place, and seventeen hundred
taken prisoners with their Major-General and above
thirty other officers. They took likewise all their
baggage and tents, all their cannon, being, as was
said before, thirteen pieces of brass ordnance, and
a brass mortar-piece: all their ammunition, being
seventy barrels of powder, and all other sorts of
ammunition proportionable, and a very great magazine
of bisket and other excellent provisions of
victuals; which was as seasonable a blessing as the
victory, to those who for three or four days before
had suffered great want of food as well as sleep, and
were equally tired with duty and hunger.'</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Perhaps I may be excused for mentioning here
that Camden quotes approvingly from Johannes
Sarisburiensis a tribute to Cornish valour, and that
Michael Cornubiensis has also referred to the
subject in the following lines:</p>

<p>Cornwall was thus cleared of the enemy, and secured
for the King; and the Cornish infantry were available
for service elsewhere: they were accordingly re-inforced
by a body of cavalry under Prince Maurice,
and the combined troops met at Chard. Clarendon
pauses to praise the loyal spirit evinced by the
Cornishmen, who, notwithstanding their late gallant
victories, now found themselves&mdash;both officers and
men&mdash;overshadowed by the superior military rank
allotted to their new associates. Nor were they less
remarkable for their discipline and conduct. 'The
Chief Commanders of the Cornish army,' says the
great historian, 'had restrained their soldiers from
all manner of licence, obliging them to frequent acts
of devotion; insomuch that the fame of their religion
and discipline was no less than of their courage.'</p>

<p>A junction with the King's troops at Oxford was
the next object of the Royalists in the west; and
they accordingly advanced through Taunton and
Bridgewater upon Wells, where they fell upon the
advanced guard of Waller's forces, which they
routed and drove back upon Bath. Here the Parliamentarian
General awaited, upon Lansdowne Hill,
the advance of the victorious and elated troops of
the King. We cannot do better than once again
listen to the tale of the fight as told in Clarendon's
own words:</p>

Waller, as soon as it was light, possessed himself of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
that hill; and after he had upon the brow of the
hill, over the highway, raised breast-works with
faggots and earth, and planted cannon there, he
sent a strong party of horse towards Marsfield;
which quickly alarmed the other army, and was
shortly driven back to their body. As great a mind
as the King's forces had to cope with the enemy,
when they had drawn into battalion, and found the
enemy fixed on the top of the hill, they resolved not
to attack them upon so great disadvantage, and so
retired again towards their old quarters: which
Sir Wm. Waller perceiving, sent his whole body of
horse and dragoons down the hill, to charge the rear
and flank of the King's forces; which they did
thoroughly, the regiment of cuirassiers so amazing
the horse they charged, that they totally routed
them; and, standing firm and unshaken themselves,
gave so great terror to the King's horse, who had
never before turned from an enemy, that no example
of their officers, who did their parts with invincible
courage, could make them charge with the same
confidence, and in the same manner they had
usually done. However, in the end, after Sir
Nicholas Slanning, with 300 musqueteers, had fallen
upon, and beaten their reserve of dragooners, Prince
Maurice, and the Earl of Carnarvon, rallying their
horse, and winging them with the Cornish musqueteers,
charged the enemy's horse again, and
totally routed them; and in the same manner
received two bodies more, and routed and chased
them to the hill; where they stood in a place almost
inaccessible. On the brow of the hill there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
breast-works, on which were pretty bodies of small
shot, and some cannon; on either flank grew a
pretty thick wood towards the declining of the hill,
in which strong parties of musqueteers were placed;
at the rear was a very fair plain, where the reserves
of horse and foot stood ranged, <em>yet the Cornish
foot were so far from being appalled at this disadvantage,
that they desired to fall on, and cried out "That they
might have leave to fetch off those cannon."</em><a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> In the
end order was given to attempt the hill with horse
and foot. 'Two strong parties of musqueteers were
sent into the woods, which flanked the enemy; and the
horse and other musqueteers up the roadway, which
were charged by the enemy's horse and routed; then
Sir Bevil Grenville advanced with a party of horse on
his right hand, that ground being best for them, and
his musqueteers on his left, himself leading up his
pikes in the middle; and in the face of their cannon,
and small shot from the breast-works, gained the
brow of the hill, having sustained two full charges of
the enemy's horse; but in the third charge his horse
failing, and giving ground, he received, after other
wounds, a blow on the head with a poll-axe, with
which he fell, and many of his officers about him;<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>yet the musqueteers fired so fast on the enemy's
horse, that they quitted their ground, and the two
wings who were sent to clear the woods, having
done their work, and gained those parts of the hill,
at the same time beat off their enemy's foot, and
became possessed of the breast-works, and so made
way for their whole body of horse, foot, and cannon,
to ascend the hill, which they quickly did, and
planted themselves on the ground they had won;
the enemy retiring about demy-culverin shot, behind
a stone wall upon the same level, and standing in
reasonable good order.</p>

<p>'Either party was sufficiently tired and battered,
to be contented to stand still. The King's horse
were so shaken, that of 2000 which were upon the
field in the morning, there were not above 600 on
the top of the hill; so that, exchanging only some
shot from their ordnance, they looked upon one
another till the night interposed. About twelve of
the clock, the night being very dark, the enemy
made a show of moving towards the ground they
had lost; but giving a smart volly of small shot,
and finding themselves answered with the like, they
made no more noise; which the Prince observing,
he sent a common soldier to hearken as near the
place where they were, as he could; who brought
word, That the enemy had left lighted matches in
the wall behind which they had lain, and were
drawn off the field; which was true; so that as
soon as it was day, the King's army found themselves
possessed entirely of the field, and the dead,
and all other ensigns of victory: Sir Wm. Waller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
being marched into Bath, in so much disorder and
apprehension, that he had left great store of arms,
and ten barrels of powder, behind him, which was
a very seasonable supply to the other side, who
had spent in that day's service no less than four
score barrels, and had not a safe proportion left.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>It is believed in the West that Sir Bevill was
attended at the Battle of Lansdowne by one of his
servants from Stow&mdash;Anthony Paine, the Cornish
Giant, of whom Mr. Stokes tells us that</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'His sword was made to match his size,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As Roundheads did remember;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when it swung 'twas like the whirl<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of windmills in September.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>And there is a further tradition that, on seeing his
master fall, Anthony at once clapped John Grenville
(afterwards first Earl of Bath), then a youth of
sixteen, on his father's steed in order to prevent the
Royalist troops from being discouraged. Anthony
measured, so it is said, seven feet two inches in
height. He was present, not only at Lansdowne,
but at the fight on Stamford Hill, and remained on
the field that night to assist in burying the dead,
after his master had returned home to Stow. At
the 'Tree' Inn, Stratton (said to have been the
headquarters of the Royalists on the night preceding
that battle), the hole in the ceiling is still shown
through which, years afterwards, the corpse of poor
Anthony was removed from the room in which he
died&mdash;his coffin being too long to be taken out of the
window or down the stairs in the usual way.</p>

<p>Thus did the worthy retainer write to his mistress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
on the terrible day of Lansdowne fight; at least so
Mr. Hawker assures us:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'Honored Madam. Ill news flieth apace. The
heavy tidings no doubt hath already traveled to
Stow that we have lost our blessed master by the
enemy's advantage. You must not, dear lady,
grieve too much for your noble spouse. You know,
as we all believe, that his soul was in heaven before
his bones were cold. He fell, as he did often tell us
he wished to die, in the great Stewart cause, for his
Country and his King. He delivered to me his last
commands, and with such tender words for you and
for his children as are not to be set down with my
poor pen, but must come to your ears upon my best
heart's breath. Master John, when I mounted him
upon his father's horse, rode him into the war like
a young prince, as he is, and our men followed him
with their swords drawn and with tears in their
eyes. They did say they would kill a rebel for every
hair of Sir Bevill's beard. But I bade them remember
their good master's word when he wiped
his sword after Stamford fight: how he said, when
their cry was "Stab and slay!"&mdash;"Halt, men! God
will avenge." I am coming down with the mournfullest
load that ever a poor servant did bear, to
bring the great heart that is cold to Kilkhampton
vault. O! my lady, how shall I ever brook your
weeping face? But I will be trothful to the living
and to the dead.</p>

<p>'These, honoured Madam, from thy saddest,
truest Servant,</p>

<p class="right">'<span class="smcap">Anthony Payne</span>.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Anthony was, at the Restoration made 'Halberdier
of the Guns' at Plymouth Citadel, and Sir Godfrey
Kneller was commissioned by the King to paint
Anthony's portrait. It was engraved as a frontispiece
to the 1st vol. of C. S. Gilbert's 'History
of Cornwall,' and the picture itself was afterwards
sold for ¬£800. And here it may perhaps
be added that at the siege of Plymouth another
Cornish man, John Langherne, of Tregavethan, of
huge strength and stature, being seven feet six
inches high, 'Rid up,' as Tonkin tells us, 'to one of
the gates of the Town, and stuck his sword in it so
deep that two strong men could not possibly pull it
out.'&mdash;(Borlase's Additional MSS.)</p>

<p>It is gratifying to learn that the Cornishmen demeaned
themselves so well at Lansdowne; but the
victory was far too dearly bought. Clarendon goes
on to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'In this battle, on the King's part, there were
more officers and gentlemen of quality slain, than
common men; and more hurt than slain. That
which would have clouded any victory, and made
the loss of others less spoken of, was the death of
Sir Bevil Grenville. He was indeed an excellent
person, whose activity, interest, and reputation was
the foundation of what had been done in Cornwall;
and his temper and affection so publick, that no
accident which happened could make any impressions
in him; and his example kept others from taking
anything ill, or at least seeming to do so. In a word,
<em>a brighter courage, and a gentler disposition</em>, were never
married together to make the most chearful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
innocent conversation.' 'Clarendon's immortals,'
says Forster, 'still lie unwithered' on Sir Bevill's
grave.</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>A monument, erected by his grandson George
Lord Lansdowne, marks the spot where our hero
fell.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> On the north side of the monument was inscribed:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Mrs. Delany has stated that Sir Bevill had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
patent for an Earldom in his pocket on the day of
the fatal fight at Lansdowne; and in this there
seems nothing improbable, as his youngest daughter,
Joan, or Johanna, had a patent of precedence as an
Earl's daughter.</p>

<p>We have seen something of Sir Bevill's epistolary
productions; and, if we are to accept the testimony
of the Rev. S. Baring-Gould, the writer of the
biography of the Rev. R. S. Hawker, some specimens
of Lady Grace's were preserved under the
following singular circumstances:</p>

<p>One day, he tells us, Mrs. Hawker, the first wife
of the Vicar of Morwenstow, when lunching at
Stow in the farmhouse, noticed that a letter in old
handwriting was wrapped round the mutton bone
that was brought on the table. Moved by curiosity,
she took the paper off, and showed it to Mr. Hawker.
On examination it was found that the letter bore
the signature of Sir Bevill Grenville. Mr. Hawker
at once instituted inquiries, and found a large chest
full of letters of different members of the Grenville
family in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
He at once communicated with Lord Carteret,
owner of Stow, and the papers were removed, but
by some unfortunate accident they were lost! The
only ones saved were a packet removed from the
chest by Mr. Davis, Rector of Kilkhampton, previous
to their being sent away from Stow. These were
copied by Miss Manning, of Eastaway, in Morwenstowe,
and her transcript, together with some of the
originals, was said to be in the possession of
Ezekiel Rous, Esq., of Bideford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The following, from Lady Grace to her husband,
was probably another of the letters in the collection
said to have been found by Mr. Hawker, and afterwards
so mysteriously lost.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'For My Best Friend, Sir Bevill Grenville.</p>
<p>'<span class="smcap">My ever Dearest</span>,</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I have received yours from Salisbury, and am
glad to hear you came so farr well, with poore Jack.
Ye shall be sure of my prairs, which is the best service
I can doe you. I canott perceave whither you
had receaved mine by Tom, or no, but I believe by
this time you have mett that and another since by
the post. Truly I have been out of frame ever since
you went, not with a cough, but in another kinde,
much indisposed. However, I have striven with it,
and was at Church last Sunday, but not the former.
I have been vexed with diverse demands made of
money than I could satisfie, but I instantly paid
what you sent, and have intreated Mr. Rous his
patience a while longer, as you directed.</p>

<p>'It grieves me to think how chargeable your
family is, considering your occasion. It hath this
many years troubled me to think to what passe it
must come at last, if it run on after this course.
How many times what hath appeared hopefull, and
yet proved contrary in the conclusion, hath befalen
us, I am loth to urge, because tis farr from my desire
to disturbe your thoughts; but this sore is not to be
curd with silence, or patience either, and while you
are loth to discourse or thinke of that you can take
little comfort to see how bad it is, and I was unwilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to strike on that string which sounds harsh in
your eare (the matter still grows worse, though). I
can never putt it out of my thoughts, and that makes
me often times seeme dreaming to you, when you
expect I should sometimes observe more complement
with my frends, or be more active in matters of
curiousity in our House, which doubtlesse you would
have been better pleasd with had I been capable to
have performd it, and I believe though I had a naturall
dullness in me, it would never so much have appeard
to my prejudice, but twas increasd by a continuance
of sundry disasters, which I still mett with, yet never
till this yeare, but I had some strength to encounter
them, and truly now I am soe cleane overcome, as
tis in vaine to deny a truth. It seems to me now tis
high time to be sensible that God is displeased,
having had many sad remembrances in our estate
and children late, yet God spard us in our children
long, and when I strive to follow your advice in
moderating my grieffe (which I praise God) I have
thus farr been able to doe as not to repine at God's
will, though I have a tender sence of griefe which
hangs on me still, and I think it as dangerous and
improper to forgett it, for I cannott but think it was
a neer touched correction, sent from God to check
me for my many neglects of my duty to God. It was
the tenth and last plague God smote the Egyptians
with, the deathe of their first borne, before he utterly
destroyed them, they persisting in their disobedience
notwithstanding all their former punishments. This
apprehension makes me both tremble and humbly
beseech Him to withdraw His punishments from us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and to give us grace to know and amend whatever is
amisse. Now I have pourd out my sad thoughts
which in your absence doth most oppresse me, and
tis my weakness hardly to be able to say thus much
unto you, how brimfull soever my heart be, though
oftentimes I heartely wish I could open my heart
truly unto you when tis overchargd. But the least
thought it may not be pleasing to you will at all times
restraine me. Consider me rightly, I beseech you,
and excuse, I pray, the liberty I take with my pen in
this kinde. And now at last I must thanke you for
wishing me to lay aside all feare, and depend on the
Almighty, who can only helpe us; for his mercy I
daily pray, and your welfare, and our poore boys;
so I conclude, and am ever your faithfully and

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The superscription of this letter is:</p>

<p>'To my ever dearest and best Friend, Mr. Bevill

<p class="p1-5" />

<p>The other letters in this collection&mdash;alleged to
have been so strangely discovered&mdash;will be found
enumerated in the Appendix to Mr. Gould's 'Life
of Hawker.'</p>

<p>There are many portraits of Sir Bevill Grenville.
One is in Prince's 'Worthies of Devon;' another in
Lloyd's 'Worthies;' and one, by Dobson, is in the
fine collection at Petworth Park. Here also is a
group described as Sir Bevill Grenville, Anne St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Leger (his grandmother!) and John Earl of Bath,
their son&mdash;after Vandyck.</p>

<p>What can be added to such tributes as those which
we have just read but that, in Sir Bevill Grenville's
case at least, 'the good was <em>not</em> interred with his
bones;'<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> his valiant spirit continued to animate his
friends and followers, and prompted their valour on
Roundway Down, at the siege of Bristol, and&mdash;when
one of the last gleams of success shone upon the
Royal cause&mdash;when Essex's infantry surrendered to
the King in person, at Fowey. On the latter
occasion Sir Richard, brother of Sir Bevill, held
and fortified Hall House, on the eastern side of the
harbour, for the King: he had previously captured
Restormel Castle near Lostwithiel.</p>

<p>Then there soon came a time when, as Macaulay
says, England had to witness spectacles such as
these: 'Major-Generals fleecing their districts&mdash;soldiers
revelling on the spoils of a ruined peasantry&mdash;upstarts,
enriched by the public plunder, taking
possession of the hospitable firesides and hereditary

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Where,' asked Dr. Llewellyn, the Principal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
St. Mary Hall, Oxford, in the stilted style of the day
in which he wrote:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Where shall next famous Grenvil's ashes stand?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy grandsire fills the sea&mdash;and thou the land.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">The answer to which question must be that the
next famous Grenville&mdash;Sir Bevill's eldest son, Sir
John&mdash;was destined to become a conspicuous figure
in the field of Diplomacy. He even attained to
a higher rank than his father, soon after the Stuart
cause became once more triumphant. Leaving
Gloucester Hall, Oxford,&mdash;where he was a Gentleman
Commoner,&mdash;when only fifteen years of age,
he commanded his father's regiment in the west;
and at the second battle of Newbury (to which he
brought his Cornish troops) he was wounded, and
left for dead on the field. He had received a dangerous
wound in the head from a halberd, and was
carried to the King and Prince of Wales, who
ordered him to be taken care of in Donnington
Castle hard by. The Castle was soon after besieged,
and the bullets constantly whistled through his
sick-room; but the boy-warrior at last came safely
off. When the Scilly Isles revolted from the Parliament
and became the last rallying-point of the
Royalists, he it was who (like one of his ancestors)
was made Governor, for the King&mdash;taking up
his quarters at Elizabeth Castle on St. Mary's
Island. But the Parliamentary Admirals, Blake
and Ayscough, appeared before Scilly with so overwhelming
a force, that Sir John Grenville thought it
best to capitulate; extorting, however, such favourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
terms that, until Blake represented to what an
extent his own honour was involved in their confirmation,
the Parliament refused to recognise them. It
is said that Sir John had with him commissioned
officers enough to 'head an army.'</p>

<p>Sir John Grenville, although he now returned
quietly to Stow, was by no means unmindful of his
royal master, and soon opened negotiations with his
cousin George Monk (afterwards Duke of Albemarle),
who became the well known chief instrument in the
restoration of Charles II. A brother of Monk's
(afterwards Bishop of Hereford), who was at this
time in Cornwall, having been appointed by the
Grenvilles to the living of Kilkhampton, seems to
have been the medium of this dangerous intercourse;
but our Sir John managed matters with such loyalty,
courage, and discretion, that all ultimately went well
for the Royal cause.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> He had at one time accompanied
Charles into exile, and was one of the Commissioners,
known as the 'Sealed Knot' from their secrecy,
appointed to conduct the affairs of the King in England
during his absence; and though Sir John Grenville
could not obtain from Monk (who was determined
upon being supreme in the transaction) the stipulations
which even Charles's most loyal friends thought
desirable for the future, events proved that it would
have been well if more weight had been attached to
the suggestions of the sagacious Cornish Knight and
his colleagues.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
So highly, however, were his fidelity and wisdom
esteemed, that he was selected to present to Parliament
the King's proposals from Breda: an office
which he discharged with such efficiency as to obtain
the thanks of both Houses, and a jewel worth ¬£500, as
well as a ring worth ¬£300 from the Common Council,
for his services at this important crisis. (Cf. also
Thurloe's 'State Papers,' Grammont's 'Memoirs,'
Clarendon's Correspondence and Diary, and Dr.
John Price's 'Mystery and Method of His Majesty's
Happy Restoration,' dedicated to the Earl of Bath.)
Pepys describes the circumstances, and tells us how,
on 2nd March, 1660, Parliament continued bareheaded
whilst the King's letter was being read.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The favours of royalty were also showered upon
Grenville&mdash;though Charles II. was apt to be unmindful
of his friends in the past&mdash;and Sir John was
made a Secretary of State, and was created Lord
Grenville, of Kilkhampton and Bytheford, Viscount
Grenville of Lansdowne, and Earl of Bath; with a
pension of ¬£3,000 a year to be paid out of the
Stannaries, of which he was made Lord Warden,
and a reversion to the Dukedom of Albemarle. He
also received the Royal Licence to use his titles of
Earl of Corboile, Thorigny, and Granville. Of the
architectural merits of his 'new house' at Stow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
built for him, it is said, by the King, Kingsley writes
in disparaging terms, as we have seen. He married
Jane, the daughter of Sir Peter Wiche or Wych, by
whom he left a noble offspring. The eldest son,
Charles, second Earl of Bath, died in 1701,&mdash;twelve
days after his father; the second son, John, who
was created Baron Grenville of Potheridge in 1703,
died in 1707; and the male line became extinct on
the death, from small-pox, of his son William Henry,
third Earl of Bath, in 1771.</p>

<p>James II., however, seems to have shown the Earl
of Bath&mdash;who was a staunch Protestant&mdash;little
favour. So Grenville declared for the Prince of
Orange; and, having first seized Plymouth citadel,
admitted the Dutch fleet into that harbour; his
nephew Bevill performing a similar service with his
uncle's own regiment at Jersey. King William III.
consequently created him a member of his Privy
Council, and continued him in his previous offices.</p>

<p>The Earl's eldest son, Charles, was accidentally
killed by the discharge of a pistol at his father's
funeral; and the title consequently devolved upon
his son William Henry, thus giving rise to the observation
that at one time there were 'three Earls of
Bath above ground at the same time.' From the
first Earl descended, in the female line, the present
representatives of the family&mdash;the Thynnes, not unknown
to fame.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And Sir Bevill had another son, Dennis, who was
by no means undistinguished in his own walk of life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Born in 1636/7, and educated probably at Eton,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> he
was entered a Gentleman Commoner of Exeter College,
Oxford, on 22nd Sept., 1657; took his degree
of M.A. on 28th Sept., 1660, and that of D.D. on 20th
Dec, 1670. Kilkhampton was his first preferment,
though he does not appear to have taken up residence
there. He was Chaplain in Ordinary to Charles II.;
and in 1684 was made Archdeacon and Dean of
Durham. But he was a true Grenville in his attachment
to the Stuarts; and early in 1690 went into
exile with James II., residing at Corbeil, in France
(near the place whence his family are supposed to
have sprung), rather than acknowledge William III.
as his sovereign. He left several works behind him,
and died in Paris in 1703.</p>

<p>There are many incidents, however, connected
with his career which seem to require a fuller notice
of the Cavalier Dean. The command, 'Fear God,'
scarcely commended itself more forcibly to his conscience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
than its complement 'Honour the King;' and,
although he was in a <em>very</em> small minority, his high-minded
consistency and loyalty were such, that,
whatever we may think of his prudence, or of the
practicability of his views, we are bound, I think, to
honour the man who chose rather to sacrifice the
highest preferments than to swear allegiance to one
whom he, at least, regarded as an invader and a
usurper.</p>

<p>There are full details of the latter part of his career
preserved in the library of the Dean and Chapter of
Durham, from which I have gathered most of the
following accounts.</p>

<p>He married Ann, daughter of Bishop Cosin (an
unhappy union, for her husband&mdash;and two physicians
confirmed his statement&mdash;alleged that the lady was
subject to fits of temporary insanity), at a time when
the Church of England was in sad disorder, and
when vigorous, earnest spirits were wanted to remedy
the listless slovenliness of many of her clergy.</p>

<p>Dennis Grenville was equal to the trying occasion.
He found that the Church services were often either
curtailed or omitted altogether; many of the churches
were 'altogether unprovided of ministers'; and the
fabrics themselves were 'ruinous and in great decay.'
Not only the minor Canons and singing men, but
even many of the highest dignitaries were guilty,
according to Cosin,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> of sluttish and disorderly habits,
even in the cathedrals themselves; and the Rubrics
and Canons were almost ignored. But, as Parish
Priest, as Prebendary, and as Archdeacon, and afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
especially in securing a weekly celebration of
the Holy Communion in his own cathedral, Dennis
Grenville laboured so earnestly and so conscientiously,
as to warrant his promotion, young as he was, to the
post of Dean.</p>

<p>His rapid advancement, however, seems to have
almost turned his head; he became ambitious and
extravagant, was frequently absent from his post,
and fell into pecuniary troubles (aggravated by the
non-payment of an expected marriage portion with
his wife) which, almost to the last, hung like a millstone
round his neck. On the 8th of July, 1674, on
returning from public prayers and Captain Foster's
funeral, he was actually arrested 'in his Hood and
Surplice' for debt, within the cloisters; and although
he was afterwards released as a Chaplain in
Ordinary of the King, and though the bailiffs and the
Under Sheriff who were responsible for his arrest were
reprimanded before the Council Board at Hampton
Court, yet the indignity seems to have entered into
the Dean's very soul, producing, however, more than
one good result, viz. the more economical management
of his resources, and salutary counsels to his
nephew at Oxford, published in 1685. He was a
capital preacher, but a bad man of business: '"I
cannot manage nor mind these money affairs," is
his own candid confession,' observes the Rev. George
Ormsby, in his interesting memoir.</p>

<p>Of the Dean's management of his own household
full details are preserved; they will probably be
found interesting here as showing how a Church
dignitary lived two hundred years ago: one who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
always at work on the scheme of reformation to
which he had laid his hands, and who seems to have
taken for his model George Herbert's 'Country
Parson.' This book he recommended to his curates,
and to all the clergy in his jurisdiction, 'for their rule
and direction in order to the exemplary discharge of
their functions, having always made it mine.' The
Diocese of Durham, under such auspices as those of
Cosin and Grenville, (notwithstanding the incapacity
of the latter to properly manage his money affairs,)
accordingly improved rapidly in tone, until the Dean
was at length able to report to the King that it was
'without dispute the most exemplary county for good
order and conformity of any in the nation.'</p>

<p>These, then, were amongst Dean Grenville's thirty-two
Home Rules:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'1. That all persons should labour to contrive
their businesse soe as to be present at God's service
in the Church, as often as possible, not only on
publick daies but private ones; never staying at
home (any one) but in cases of infirmity, or of some
necessary lawfull impediment.'</p>

<p>'3. That as soon as the bells of the Church begin
to ring or toll, all persons who intend to goe to the
Church at that time shall begin to put themselves in
readinesse, and wait for mee in the parlour and the
hall, that they may all goe forth with mee at the
same time (for which purpose there shall be given
one toll of my House bell) and accompany mee to
the Church, not dropping in one after another after
service is begun.'</p>

<p>'5. That all persons of my family shall carry their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Bibles and Common Prayer-books to the Church
with them, and use them in the performance of the
Service and Lessons.</p>

<p>'6. That when I keep daily labourers in the
summer time, or have any number of servants imployed
without doores, that must goe to their worke
abroad, before the houre of morning prayers, that
they repaire to my house, and have some short
prayers in my hall at five of the clock, or at such
houre and in such manner as I shall appoint.'</p>

<p>'11. That in case the worke and imployment of my
house bee too much to bee dispatched in the forenoon
or before Evening Prayers on such daies, I doe
allow of the hiring one, two or three women for the
spedier dispatch of the same.</p>

<p>'12. That I allow all my domesticks some time
every day for private prayer and reading of the
Scriptures (nay, doe in the Name of God injoyne
every person to imploy some to that purpose), and
that every person may have some reasonable time
and liberty for devotion, and not be oppressed with
too much businesse, I am willing to keep a servant
or two more than would bee other wise necessary.'</p>

<p>'14. That all persons playing at any game (tho'
they are in the middle of a game) shall breake it
off and cease their play, soe soon as the bell tolls
for prayers, either in church or chaple, or as soon
as the Butler appears with the things to lay the cloth
for dinner or supper.</p>

<p>'15. That there shall bee noe playing in my family
at any game on the Vigills and other fasting daies of
the Church, nor on Fridaies and Saturdaies (unlesse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
within the 12 daies of Christmasse), but that what
time shall be gained from necessary businesse bee
better imployed in devotion, reading, good conference
or the like.</p>

<p>'16. That to the former end and purpose I doe
order my chesseboard, bowles, and all other things
relating to such games (as I doe allow) to be locked
up on Thursday night till Monday morning, as alsoe
on other daies before mentioned.</p>

<p>'17. That I allow of noe great game for any considerable
summe to bee played in my family, nor
indeed of any at all when my poor box is forgotten,
which I doe recommend more earnestly than my
Butler's.</p>

<p>'18. That at nine o'clock, our family prayers being
ended, all persons shall repair to their chambers;
and are desired to dismisse the servants soe soon as
possible, that they may put the house in order,
and go to their beds near ten of the clock or by
eleven at farthest....'</p>

<p>'20. That my house bell be rung every morning at
5 in the winter, and about 4 in the summer to
awaken my family, and alarume my servants to arise,
and to give opportunity and incouragement to early
risers, who are alwaies the most welcome persons to
my family.'</p>

<p>'25. That there shall bee no dinners on Wednesdaies
and Fridaies in Lent.'</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pad4">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</span></p>
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>But James II.'s 'Second Declaration of Indulgence,'
7th April, 1688, an attempt to divide the Protestant
party, and to secure the favour of the Non-conformists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
after having failed to seduce from their
allegiance the leaders of the Church of England,
placed the Dean in a most trying position. His
loyalty to his Church was in conflict with his loyalty
to his Sovereign; and the latter prevailed: 'If the
King goes beyond his Commission, he must answer
for it to God, but I'le not deface one line thereof.
Let my liege and dread Sovereign intend to do what
he pleases to me or mine: yet my hand shall never
be upon him, so much as to cut off the skirt of his
garment.' Not only (to the Dean's intense grief) did
his elder brother, the Earl of Bath, now desert the
Stuart cause, but another Cornish Church dignitary
of this period&mdash;Bishop Jonathan Trelawney&mdash;took
the bolder course of opposing the King's views,
thus exemplifying the old Cornish saying that
a <em>Trelawny never wanted courage, nor a Grenville
loyalty</em>. It is needless to repeat that the Dean of
Durham found himself in a <em>very</em> small minority.</p>

<p>His loyalty was about to undergo another and a
severer test. In the autumn of 1688 news arrived
of the projected 'invasion and usurpation,' as our
Dean would always call it, of the Prince of Orange:
at once he summoned his Chapter, prevailed
upon them to assist the King's cause 'with their
purses as well as their prayers,' and ¬£700 were
accordingly subscribed forthwith. But Lord Lumley
pounced upon Durham on the 6th of December in
that year, whilst the Dean was in his pulpit preaching
a sermon, still preserved in the Surtees Collection,
on 'Christian Resignation and Resolution, with
some loyal reflexions on the Dutch Invasion'; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Dr. Grenville was, on his refusal to deliver up his
arms and horses, confined within the walls of his
own Deanery during the occupation of the city by
the friends of King William III. Another similar
sermon, however, did he, with undaunted courage,
preach on the following Sunday, notwithstanding his
now almost solitary position amongst his brother
clergy. But James's cause was entirely lost; and
our Dean had to fly from Durham to Carlisle at
midnight on the 11th of December, with the help
of two faithful servants. At Carlisle he learned that
all was over, and made up his mind to follow his
King into France, if only he could make good his
escape by way of Edinburgh. On his way thither
he was roughly handled by a mob, who took him
for a Popish priest and Jesuit, and at eleven at
night 'pulled me out of my bed, rifling my pockets
and my chamber, and carrying away my horses
(two geldings worth ¬£40) and my portmantoe, and
mounting me on a little jade not worth 40s.' Once
more he was plundered on the road, and returned
to Carlisle, where he preached on Christmas Day,
when he says he hoped that he convinced the people
that he was no Romanist.</p>

<p>In the following month, however, he made another
attempt&mdash;this time successfully&mdash;to reach Edinburgh;
and after a long and tedious voyage, arrived
at Honfleur on the 19th March&mdash;the very day
after James had left Brest for Ireland, 'a great
mortification and disappointment to mee,' adds
Dean Grenville. Rouen was the place which he had
fixed upon for his abode, and thither he removed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
few days afterwards, forthwith setting about writing
remonstrances to his Bishop, his brother, and his
'lapsed assistants,' his Curates; printing his sermons,
to which reference has just been made, and also his
'Loyall farewell Visitation Speech,' delivered on 15th
November, 1688.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Little remains to be told of him, but that he was
formally deprived on the appointed date of 1st
February, 1690/1, and his goods and chattels were
distrained by the Sheriff, in consequence of his
continued pecuniary embarrassments; his library,
also, which was very rich in Bibles and Prayer-books,
was purchased by Sir George Wheeler; and the
Chapter had to grant the unhappy Mrs. Grenville an
allowance of ¬£80 a year 'in compassion to her
necessities.' She died twelve years before her husband,
and was buried in Durham Cathedral.</p>

<p>Nor did James, to whose Court at St. Germains
Dennis Grenville shortly afterwards repaired, by any
means console his faithful servant for the troubles
and trials he had undergone in his King's behalf.
'He was slighted,' says Surtees, in his 'History of
Durham,' 'by the bigoted Prince, for whom he had
forfeited every worldly possession, because he would
not also abandon his religion.'<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> In fact, the Dean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>was at length compelled to retire from the Court to
Corbeil, his ancestral home, about twenty miles from
Paris, in consequence of the indignities heaped upon
him there by his ecclesiastical opponents, and by their
persistent, though vain, attempts to draw him into
polemical discussions. Whilst in France, he sometimes
went by the name of Corbeil&mdash;sometimes by
the name of Stotherd; and here it may be added,
that Mr. H. R. Fox Bourne, in his 'Life of John
Locke,' mentions that the illustrious metaphysician
and Dean Grenville were old friends, and that they
corresponded in 1677-78 on the subjects of
Recreation and Scrupulosity. Copies of the letters
are in the British Museum, Additional MSS. 4290.
Mr. Bourne states that James II. actually appointed
Dean Grenville Roman Catholic Archbishop of
York.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Two furtive journeys did he make to England, in
disguise&mdash;one in February, 1689-90, 'whereby he
got a small sum of money to subsist while abroad
... tho' with much trouble and danger occasioned
him by an impertinent and malitious post master,
who discovered him in Canterbury;' and once again
in 1695, probably with the same object. In 1702 he
wrote an amusing letter to his nephew, Sir George
Wheeler, acknowledging 'a seasonable supply' of
¬£20, from which it may be gathered that he preserved
to the last his unbroken and cheerful spirit. But,
in the following year, on Wednesday, the 8th April,
1703, at six in the morning, the exiled, supplanted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and childless Dean of Durham died&mdash;as he asserts,
himself, in the preamble of his will&mdash;a true son of the
Church of England, at his lodgings at the Foss√©e
St. Victoire, in Paris, in the sixty-seventh year of
his age.</p>

<p>His portrait, admirably engraved by Edelinck,
was painted by Beaupoille when Dean Grenville was
fifty-four years of age; a print of it is prefixed to the
copy of his 'Farewell Sermons' preserved in the
Bodleian Library, and there is another copy in the
British Museum. His character may almost be
gathered from what we have seen of his life and
works; and it should be added that he was not only of
good natural abilities, but also no mean scholar. His
kinsman, Lord Lansdowne, may have drawn a somewhat
too eulogistic account of the Dean; but, overshadowed
as his fame undoubtedly is by the greater
names of his ancestors, Sir Richard and Sir Bevill,
it should never be forgotten that he was an energetic
reformer, in very difficult times, of the Church
and the clergy;&mdash;though, as he says, '<em>his</em> religion
and loyalty were not of the new cutt, but of the
old royall stamp;'&mdash;yet he was the friend of such
men as Beveridge and Comber&mdash;and, above all,
it should be remembered that, whatever we may
think of his judgment, he undoubtedly performed
that rare act of moral heroism, the sacrifice of his
dignities and honours, his ample revenues, all the
comforts of his native land, and, in fact, all his
worldly interests, to his <em>conscience</em>.</p>

<p>Well might it have been said of Dennis Grenville
that his</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Loyalty was still the same<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether it won or lost the game;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True as the dial to the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Altho' it be not shone upon;'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">and truly might he have exclaimed, whilst in exile
and poverty paying the penalty of his loyal attachment
to the House of Stuart, in the words of one
of the Roxburgh Ballads:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Then hang up sorrow and care,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It never shall make me rue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What though my back goes bare?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'm ragged and torn and <span class="smcap">true</span>.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>He wrote to his elder brother&mdash;the Earl of Bath&mdash;a
reproachful letter, in November, 1689, wherein
he says, evidently hoping against hope, that
nothing 'shall convince him that it is possible for
one descended from his dear loyall father Sir Bevill
Grenville to dye a rebell;' but I confess that the
sentiment of Dean Grenville's which I prefer
treasuring in my own memory, is the noble
and tolerant one with which he concludes his
'Third Speech' to his clergy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'My fourth and last counsell is, to be just to all
men, both to the Romanist and Dissenter. That
your aversion to the doctrine of any party (tho'
never soe contrary to your owne) should not, in any
manner, exceed youer love and concerne for the
Religion you profess.'<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>To one more only of the Grenvilles does it seem
necessary to refer, as with him the connexion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
that illustrious family with Cornwall ceases: viz.,
to George Baron Lansdowne, the poet, who was
a nephew of the Dean and a grandson of Sir Bevill.
His father's as well as his brother's name was
Bernard. It is true that he did not live at Stow,
which, as we have seen, was no longer the family
mansion; but he comes within our scope: for, in
a defence of his grand-uncle, Sir Richard ('Skellum')
against some anonymous author who took the side
of the Parliament, I find him writing thus: '<em>Like
an old staunch Cornishman</em> I tell you that we, who
had before beaten two of your generals into the
sea, might as well have beaten the third:' and
again, in a letter, in 1718, to his 'dearest niece,'
Mrs. Delany, he calls Cornwall 'his country.'</p>

<p>He was entered at Trinity College, Cambridge,
in 1667, and was about the Court of James II., much
smitten, it was said, with the charms of his Queen,
Mary of Modena&mdash;the Myra, in all probability, of
some of his amatory lines. He wrote both poems
and plays, many passages in which are of a somewhat
licentious character: amongst the plays are
the 'British Enchanters' (for which Addison wrote
the Epilogue); the 'She Gallants, or once a
Lover always a Lover;' and the 'Jew of Venice,'
imitated from Shakespeare. He was Member of
Parliament successively for Fowey, Lostwithiel,
Helston, and finally for the county of Cornwall
itself; and was at length made by Queen Anne a
Privy Councillor, and Treasurer of the Household,
but, on some silly suspicion of plotting against the
Government, was, in 1715, committed to the Tower,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
from which place of confinement, however, he was
shortly released. In 1722, his affairs becoming embarrassed
through his somewhat extravagant mode
of life, he went abroad to retrench his expenses; and,
returning to England, died at his house in Hanover
Square on the 30th January, 1735. He had married
the widow of Thomas Thynne,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and was celebrated
for his tender devotion to his family.</p>

<p>A curious story about his remains is told in Lady
Llanover's 'Life of Mrs. Delany.' No tomb or tablet
of any kind marks (in St. Clement Danes Church)
the site of their sepulchre; and when inquiries
on this point were made in 1859, it was found
that a short time previous to that date an order to
close a vault under the Church had been put in force.
The coffins in the vault were placed in the centre of
the chamber, a quantity of quicklime was thrown
in, and the whole then filled with rubbish. There
were two bodies in the vault which had always been
called 'My Lord and my Lady,' and which were in
extraordinary preservation. They were not skeletons,
although the skin was much dried, and they were
very light; they were set upright against the wall,
and it had always been the custom whenever a new
clerk was appointed, to take him down into the vault
and introduce him to 'My Lord and my Lady.' It
seems not at all improbable that these were the
corpses of Lord and Lady Lansdowne; and that their
remarkable preservation was due to their having
been embalmed. Lord Lansdowne's portrait may
be seen in the 'Life of Mrs. Delany,' vol. i., p. 418.
She says of him:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
'No man had more the art of winning the affections
where he wished to oblige  ... he was magnificent
in his nature, and valued no expense that would
gratify it, which in the end hurt him and his family
extremely.'</p>

<p>Of his character, as a man and as a poet, Anderson
thus writes in his 'Poets of Great Britain:'</p>

<p>'The character of Granville seems to have been
amiable and respectable. His good nature and
politeness have been celebrated by Pope, and many
other poets of the first eminence. The lustre of his
rank no doubt procured him more incense than the
force of his genius would otherwise have attracted;
but he appears not to have been destitute of fine
parts, which were, however, rather elegantly polished
than great in themselves.</p>

<p>'There is perhaps nothing more interesting in his
character than the veneration he had for some, and
the tenderness he had for all of his family. Of the
former his historical performances afford some
pleasing proof; of the latter, there are extant two
letters, one to his cousin, the last Earl of Bath, and
the other to his cousin, Mr. Bevil Granville, on his
entering into holy orders, written with a tenderness,
a freedom, and an honesty which render them invaluable.</p>

<p>'The general character of his poetry is elegance,
sprightliness and dignity. He is seldom tender, and
very rarely sublime. In his smaller pieces he endeavours
to be gay, in his larger to be great. Of
his airy and light productions the chief source is
gallantry, and the chief defect a superabundance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
sentiment and illustrations from mythology. He
seldom fetches an amorous sentiment from the
depth of science. His thoughts are such as a liberal
conversation and large acquaintance with life would
easily supply. His diction is chaste and elegant,
and his versification, which he borrowed from Waller,
is rather smooth than strong.</p>

<p>'Mr. Granville,' says Dr. Felton, 'is the poetical
son of Waller. We observe with pleasure, similitude
of wit in the difference of years, and with
Granville do meet at once the fire of his father's
youth, and judgment of his age. He hath rivalled
him in his finest address, and is as happy as ever he
was in raising modern compliments upon ancient
story, and setting off the British valour and the
English beauty with the old gods and goddesses!'</p>

<p>'Granville,' says Lord Orford, 'imitated Waller,
but as that poet has been much excelled since, a
faint copy of a faint master must strike still less.'</p>

<p>The estimate of his poetical character, given by
Dr. Johnson, is, in some respects, less favourable:</p>

<p>'Granville,' says the Doctor, 'was a man illustrious
by his birth, and therefore attracted notice;
since he is by Pope styled "the polite," he must be
supposed elegant in his manner, and generally loved;
he was in times of contest and turbulence steady to
his party, and obtained that esteem which is always
conferred upon firmness and consistency. With these
advantages, having learned the art of versifying, he
declared himself a poet, and his claim to the laurel
was allowed.'</p>

of Mrs. Martyn, of Harleston, Torquay. Fragments of it may be
seen in the cottages and gardens of Coombe, under the hill on which Stow
once stood, and it is said that the staircase is at Prideaux Place, Padstow;
but it is believed that the greater portion of the materials were removed
to South Molton, where the town-hall was erected with them; and,
according to Polewhele, traces of them were also to be seen at Star Hill
and other places in that neighbourhood.

the Cornish forces lay at Liskeard, Saltash, Launceston, Bridgerule and
Stratton. Lord Mohun was at Liskeard, Slanning at Saltash, Trevanion
at Launceston; Sir Bevill Grenville was at Stratton, with 1,200
men. Sir Bevill was described as colonel of one foot regiment,
Basset of another, Trevanion, the elder, of a third&mdash;he had Arundell
for a lieutenant-colonel, and Trelawny for his sergeant-major, two of
his captains were Burlacy and Boskoyne (? Borlase and Boscawen)&mdash;Trevanion,
the younger, of a fourth, with Edgecombe as his lieutenant-colonel,
and Carew as his sergeant-major; and Godolphin colonel
of a fifth. The Cornish gave out that they were 10,000 to 12,000
strong&mdash;but 'of fighting men in pay,' says the writer of this interesting
tract, 'we know for certaine not full 6,000.'</p></div>

And there was another (in a red dress) belonging to the late
Rev. Lord John Thynne, dated two years later; in this the likeness to
her son is very striking. Her sister, Lady Elizabeth Monk, was the

<p><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> In Boconnoc Park, near the gate of Rookwood Grove, was an
ancient oak, under which, according to tradition, an attempt was made
to assassinate the King whilst receiving the sacrament. A hole, (made
by woodpeckers) used to be shown in support of the tradition. Polwhele
fancies the story must have arisen from the King's having really
been shot at whilst in the Hall walk, Fowey, when a fisherman, who was
gazing at his Majesty, was killed. On this occasion it is said that on
8th Aug., 1644, King Charles 'lay in the field all night in his coach' on
Boconnoc Down, having been 'affrighted by the Militia' out of Lord
Mohun's house at Boconnoc.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29" id="Footnote_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> It will be remembered how the eagerness of the Grenville, Godolphin,
Basset, and Trevanion troops of Cornishmen at the siege of
Bristol precipitated the attack on 26th July, 1643, and greatly contributed
to the capture of that city for the King. Here, and at Lansdowne, fell
the flower of the Cornish chivalry.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_30" id="Footnote_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> Sir John Hinton, M.D., in his 'Memorial to Charles II.,' writes:
'In his extremity I was the last man that had him by the hand before
he dyed.' His body was brought to Stow, and deposited in the
family vault in Kilkhampton Church, July 26th, 1643; and the remains
of his 'deare love and best friend,' the Lady Grace, were laid by his
side four years afterwards.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31" id="Footnote_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> A writer in 'Notes and Queries' says that Sir Bevill did not die
on the spot, but that he expired next day at Cold Aston (Ashton) Parsonage,
some four or five miles to the north of the battle-field.
</p>
<p>
Green, in his 'History of the English People,' thus refers to the
event:
</p>
<p>
'Nowhere was the Royal cause to take so brave or noble a form as
among the Cornishmen. Cornwall stood apart from the general life of
England: cut off from it not only by differences of blood and speech,
but by the feudal tendencies of its people, who clung with a Celtic
loyalty to their local chieftains, and suffered their fidelity to the Crown
to determine their own. They had as yet done little more than keep
the war out of their own county; but the march of a small Parliamentary
force under Lord Stamford upon Launceston, forced them into
action. A little brave band of Cornishmen gathered around the chivalrous
<em>Sir Bevil Greenvil</em>, "so destitute of provisions that the best
officers had but a biscuit a day," and with only a handful of powder for
the whole force; but, starving and out-numbered as they were, they
scaled the steep rise of Stratton Hill, sword in hand, and drove Stamford
back to Exeter, with a loss of two thousand men, his ordnance and
baggage train. Sir Ralph Hopton, the best of the Royalist generals,
took the command of their army as it advanced into Somerset, and
drew the stress of the war into the west. Essex despatched a picked
force under Sir William Waller to check their advance; but Somerset
was already lost ere he reached Bath, and the Cornishmen stormed his
strong position on Lansdowne Hill in the teeth of his guns.'</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_32" id="Footnote_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> Sir Bevill Grenville was forty-eight years of age at the time of his
death, as appears by the following record of his birth in the parish
register at Kilkhampton:
</p>
<p>
'Bevell, the sonne of the worshipful Bernarde Greynville, Esquire,
was borne and baptized at Brinn in Cornwall, Ao. Dni. 1595.'
</p>
<p>
In the margin, 'Marche 1595, borne the 23d day; baptized the
25th day of Marche.'</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_33" id="Footnote_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> Sir Bevill's name and memory were of course long revered in the
family. Mrs. Delany was particularly anxious that it should be always
borne by some member of it, and it may be convenient to note here
that his grandson, Sir Bevill Grenville, was Governor of Barbadoes, in
1704 (cf. Rawlinson, A 271, Bodleian Library), a major-general in the
army, and M.P. for Fowey, 1685-89.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_34" id="Footnote_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> Echard gives some interesting details respecting the conduct of this
delicate business; and Masson refers to it in his 'Life of Milton'
(vol. v.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_35" id="Footnote_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> The following extract from Pepys is so amusing that I cannot forbear
inserting it: 'This afternoon Mr. Ed. Pickering told me in what a
sad, poor condition for clothes and money the King was, and all his
attendants, when he came to him first from my Lord, their clothes not
being worth forty shillings the best of them. And how overjoyed the
King was when Sir J. Greenville brought him some money: so joyful,
that he called the Princess Royal and Duke of York to look upon it as
it lay in the portmanteau before it was taken out.'</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_36" id="Footnote_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> This appears the more probable from the following passage, which
occurs in Lyte's 'History of Eton College' (p. 269): 'The keen competition
for Fellowships, which we have noticed at the period of the Restoration,
continued almost throughout the reign of Charles II. Sir John Grenville
was not satisfied with having procured the Provostship for his kinsman,
Nicholas Monk, and applied to the King for a Fellowship for his
own brother. The vacancy caused by the death of Grey had just been
filled up, but it was arranged that Denis Grenville should have the
next. But, though the letter in his favour was confirmed sixteen
months later, the Fellowship which Meredith resigned on his promotion
to the Provostship, was granted by the forgetful King to Dr. Heaver,
of Windsor. The Grenvilles were naturally indignant at such treatment,
and the King had to write to the Provost and Fellows, explaining
that the late appointment had been made in consequence of Laud's
decree of 1634, which annexed a Fellowship at Eton to the Vicarage of
Windsor, and once more bidding them reserve the next place for Grenville,
whose family had rendered such eminent services to the Royalist
cause.</p></div>

<p class="drop-capi2"><span class="smcap">An</span> artist might have a worse subject for a
picture than the interview to which we
are about to refer. The Vicar of Manaccan,
the Rev. Richard Polwhele, of Polwhele,
ever busy in gathering information about Cornwall
and Cornishmen, one day near the beginning of
the present century, rides over to the quaint and
pretty little fishing-cove of Coverack, near the Lizard,
to have a chat with old Mrs. Loveday Incledon, the
mother of the 'rantin' roarin' blade' (the youngest,
I fancy, of a somewhat numerous family) who forms
the subject of this memoir. Polwhele probably
passed through the quiet little village of St. Keverne
(with&mdash;that unusual sight in Cornwall&mdash;a tall <em>spire</em>
and a large church), where our hero was born.
Reaching Coverack, the worthy Vicar doubtless
opened the siege in due form, and with regular
approaches to the old lady; but all his skill and
blandishments were in vain. She would tell him
plenty about the rebellion of '45, and repeat many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
scraps of old ballads referring to it; but not one
word would she say about her <em>son</em>, then in the
meridian of his fame. It was, however, probably
she who told Polwhele that all the Incledons were
musical, and that her boy Benjamin's aunt was celebrated
for her rendering of 'Black-eyed Susan;'&mdash;but
in the end the Vicar had to remount his nag,
and return to his snug Vicarage of Manaccan, not
much wiser than when he left it in the morning.</p>

<p>Whether Incledon's mother's reticence was due to
old age, or to the almost invariable reluctance of
elderly people in the country to discuss family affairs
with '<em>strangers</em>,' it would be hard to say; but it could
scarcely be because the mention of her son's name
and career gave her pain; for in her declining years
he was the main source of her support till she died,
after her husband, in 1808, eighty-one years of age.
Incledon's father was a member of the medical profession,
but probably not entitled to be described, as
he was in some of the books of the day, as 'a
respectable <em>physician</em>.' There is, however, a cosy
little inn at St. Keverne, and on one of the stone
posts of the back-door I have seen, deeply cut, the
letters 'MICHAEL INCLEDON.' This would
seem to give us perhaps the only clue now left to the
home, during his boyhood, of the finest English
singer of his day.</p>

<p>Cornwall has always been celebrated for the rich
quality of its bass voices, but is not remarkable for
the number or excellence of those of the tenor
register. Incledon may almost be said to have
possessed both; for, in his prime, his natural voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
ranged from A to G (fourteen notes), and his singularly
sweet and powerful falsetto from D to E or F
(ten notes). It is not difficult to understand that,
even more than a hundred years ago, the fame of a fine
voice might travel eastward as far as Exeter Cathedral,
where Jackson, whose once popular 'Te Deum'
and many pleasing ballads and duets are familiar to
most of us, then held the post of organist; and accordingly,
under him was little Incledon placed about the
year 1772, when eight years old. His voice delighted
everybody, and he became 'a little idol.'</p>

<p>Bernard, who wrote the 'Theatrical Retrospections,'
made Incledon's acquaintance whilst he was
under Dr. Jackson's care, and says he did not at
that time perceive anything remarkable in his voice
or style. The boy was then a tall, lanky lad of
fifteen, chiefly noticeable for his 'courage, gratefulness,
and love of the water'&mdash;in fact, adds Bernard,
more Newfoundland dog than boy. A gentleman
of Exeter offered a money reward to any lad who
would swim out to a certain moored boat, with a
rope on his shoulders, and swim back with it again.
The task, however, baffled all the Exeter boys, till
young Incledon made the attempt, and, when he
had earned the prize, handed the money immediately
to a poor widow who had been kind to him.
Bernard seems to have been a good friend of
Incledon's through life; and Davy, the composer,
whose acquaintance was also made about this time,
was another. He, too, was a Cornishman, according
to some writers,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and was Incledon's 'coach' when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
any new part or song had to be prepared. It was
through Bernard that Incledon got his first start in
life, at Bath, to which event reference will shortly be
made.</p>

<p>But Incledon has not yet left Exeter (although it
is not altogether improbable that he had already attempted<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
to do so), and here he continued his duties as
chorister for awhile. It is said that when Judge Nares
attended service at Exeter Cathedral, he was so
entranced by the boy Incledon's singing 'Let the Soul
live,' that he burst into tears, and at the end of
the service sent the little fellow a present of five
guineas. After having failed altogether to trace
this piece of music, I am indebted to my friend,
Mr. W. H. Cummings, the eminent tenor, and the
biographer of Purcell, for the suggestion that it is
probably part of one of Jackson's unpublished
anthems.</p>

<p>Either the imposed restraint, and the punctuality
and decorum of the Cathedral services, were too much
for him, or (according to another suggestion) he was
witness of some Cathedral scandal which it was
thought desirable to keep quiet; at any rate, when
about fifteen years old, Master Incledon at length
successfully broke his fetters, and went as a sailor
in his Majesty's navy, on board the <i>Formidable</i>,
Captain Cleland, with whom he sailed to the West
Indies. There he afterwards changed his ship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and joined the <i>Raisonnable</i>. He remained in the navy
for about four years, and was present in more than
one action; notably, whilst on board the <i>Formidable</i>
of 90 guns, in the famous fight of 12th April,
1782, between Lord Rodney (then Sir Geo. Brydges
Rodney) and the French Admiral, Comte de Grasse,
in the West Indian Archipelago,&mdash;when, after a fight
which lasted the livelong day, and during which
9,000 French and Spaniards were killed and wounded,
the British victory saved Jamaica from the enemy,
and revived the then drooping fortunes of England.</p>

<p>Incledon seems to have made himself a great
favourite amongst all classes on board the fleet, who
were not only delighted by his magnificent singing,
but also welcomed a boon companion. Admirals
Pigot and Hughes were almost always singing glees
and catches with the lad. The atmosphere must
have been very congenial to him; and it was probably
during this period of his life that he not only
contracted the low tastes and hard-drinking habits
which disfigured his career, yet, doubtless, he also
now acquired that sea-faring style which enabled
him to sing 'The Storm,'<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> 'Cease, rude Boreas!
blustering railer,' etc., in such a way as they have
never been sung before or since,</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
<p>Admiral Lord Hervey became one of his chief
patrons; and, in conjunction with Lord Mulgrave,
Admiral Pigot, and others, on Incledon's return to
England in 1783, these officers introduced him to
Sheridan and to Colman&mdash;'the modern Terence,' as
the latter was called&mdash;with a view to Incledon's
appearing on the stage. It was not usual in those
days for managers to fail to carry out the wishes of
noble and influential patrons; but neither Sheridan
nor Colman, whose practised eyes probably at once
discovered that Incledon was no actor,&mdash;nor ever
likely to make one&mdash;that his pronunciation was
coarse, and that moreover his face and figure were
somewhat sailor-like and ungainly,&mdash;could be prevailed
upon to give the aspirant for histrionic
honours, then in his nineteenth year, even a <em>trial</em>.</p>

<p>Not to be balked, however, in his intentions, our
hero proceeded to Southampton, where Collins's
itinerant dramatic company was then performing;
and here he made his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d√©but</i> as Alfonso in 'The
Castle of Andalusia,' with what result I have been
unable to discover, though it would be interesting
to learn; his salary (very acceptable, small as it
was) was only some ten or fifteen shillings a week.
He remained with this company for about a year,
travelling with them to Winchester, and thence on foot
to Bath, where he arrived 'with his last shilling in his
pocket.' At Bath his great musical talents seem
first to have been recognised&mdash;yet even there tardily,
as he was for a long time engaged merely as a
chorus singer, and was still miserably paid accordingly;
though his salary was now raised to thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
shillings a week. His first appearance as a soloist is
said to have been as Edwin, in 'Robin Hood.'</p>

<p>But one night Incledon had to sing a song 'between
the acts'&mdash;an old practice, now fallen into disuse,
but then prevalent at many theatres, and which
afforded amusement to the audience whilst the
cumbrous scenes were being slowly shifted by
few and clumsy hands. One of the audience
happened to be Rauzzini, an Italian singer and
teacher at the fashionable watering-place; and he
(notwithstanding his usual contempt for English
singers) instantly detected the exceptional range
and quality of Incledon's voice. He is said to have
rushed behind the scenes, exclaiming: 'Incledon!
Sare! I tank you for the pleasure you af give me:
you vas de fus Engleesh singer I have hear vat can
sing. Sare! you af got a voice&mdash;you af got a voice!'
On another occasion, Incledon, at the conclusion of
one of his ballads, made a roulade in a way altogether
his own&mdash;rolling his voice grandly up like the
surge of the sea, till, touching the top note, it died
away in sweetness&mdash;causing Rauzzini to ejaculate:
'Coot Cot! it vas vere lucky dere vas some roof dere,
or dat fellow vould be hear by de ainshels in hev'n.'
Rauzzini at once became his friend; and, for six
or seven years, his instructor; and Incledon, who
now joined the 'Noblemen's and Gentlemen's Glee
Club,' was at length on the high-road to success.</p>

<p>The London stage was, however, still the object of
his ambition; and in the summers of 1786 to 1789, he at
length succeeded in procuring engagements at Vauxhall
Gardens, which resulted in a great triumph. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
singing of 'The Lass of Richmond Hill' was,
especially, so popular, that copies of the song were sold
at one shilling each, instead of the usual sixpence.
Still, Vauxhall was not 'the stage;' and, indeed,
the regular actors looked down upon the Vauxhall
performers as being artists of an inferior rank, so
that poor Incledon's engagement there rather retarded
than hastened the gratification of his wishes.
At length actors' jealousies and managers' reluctance
all had to give way to the sheer force of
Incledon's unsurpassable voice and growing fame;
and on the 20th January, 1790,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> he made his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d√©but</i> at
Covent Garden in the character of Dermot in 'The
Poor Soldier.' His engagement was for three years,
at ¬£6, ¬£7, and ¬£8 a week. The applause with which
he was received was general and sincere; his success
was assured; and he became, from his rollicking,
generous, sailor-like disposition, a favourite, both
before and behind the scenes. He was always either
playing off practical jokes upon others, or becoming
the butt of them himself; and the latter was notably
the case whenever Incledon was about to take his
'benefit.' On these occasions he was always very
anxious about his success, and so credulous, that he
believed all that the theatrical wags told him. Inquiring
on one occasion as to how the list of his
patrons was progressing, he was informed that 'the
Marquis of Piccadilly' had just taken some tickets,
and that 'the Duke of Windsor' had written for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
box. 'Ah!' says Incledon, 'he must be one of the
Royal Family, I suppose.' He was further delighted&mdash;or
seemed to be so&mdash;when he was told that 'Lord
Highgate' and the 'Bishop of Gravesend' were also
coming.</p>

<p>But the author of the 'Records of a Stage
Veteran' asserts that Incledon was not so silly or
unlearned as he pretended to be, and could give a
Roland (often coarse enough) for an Oliver. When
some of the poorer actresses, relying upon his open-handed
generosity, used to besiege him in the cold
weather for donations to purchase flannel, they
always got some money from him; but they not
unfrequently repaired forthwith to the 'Brown
Bear,' and invested it in egg-flip, which in consequence,
it is said, soon came to bear the <em>alias</em> of
'flannel' in the green-room. When Incledon found
this out, he took his revenge by sprinkling some
'flannel' with ipecacuanha, and so saved his pocket
from similar forays for the future. In 1804, he joined
the Duke of Cumberland's sharp-shooters; but, being
so fat, the story goes that he and Cooke were
generally last of the skirmishers. On one occasion
he gave a butcher-boy a shilling to carry his gun
for him, and, on another, a shilling to a little girl to
carry his sword, which was always getting between
his legs; and he thus appeared with his two young
subalterns on parade.</p>

<p>On the 26th February, 1791, Shield's operetta of
'The Woodman' was brought out at Covent Garden;
and Incledon, now earning a salary of ¬£16 a week,
or ¬£2 more than was then paid to any other English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
singer, enraptured all his hearers by the way in
which he sang 'The Streamlet.' 'The Cabinet,' in
which operetta he sang during the winter of 1804,
with Braham and Storace, was also, like 'The
English Fleet,' highly popular with the public; but
Incledon's favourite part was Captain Macheath in
the 'Beggar's Opera'&mdash;to play which he used to
say he would always willingly get up in the middle
of the night. And here it may be observed, that
Braham gradually delegated to Incledon most of his
younger <em>r√¥les</em>; but Dibdin tells us that, as Incledon's
fame advanced, he had to be very cautious, in writing
for the stage, to allot equally prominent parts to
Incledon and to Braham. 'If one had a ballad, the
other was also to have one; each a martial or a hunting
song; each a bravura; and if they were to have a
duet, each one was to lead alternately.' As an illustration
of the relations which existed between the singer
and the librettist, I may quote a letter which, about
the year 1807, Incledon wrote to Dibdin from
Norwich:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'<span class="smcap">Dear Tom</span>,</p>

<p class="pyy right">'<span class="smcap">C. Incledon</span>. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>'P.S. D&mdash;n such paper.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Incledon seems to have been at this time devotedly
attached to his profession, and was perfectly furious
when hoarseness or any other form of illness prevented
his appearing in public. He was now in the
zenith of his fame, and a musical critic of the period
has thus described his voice and style:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'His natural voice was full and open, neither partaking
of the reed nor the string, and was sent forth
without the smallest artifice; such was its ductility,
that when he sang pianissimo, it retained its original
quality. His falsetto was rich and brilliant, but
totally unlike the other. He took it without preparation,
according to circumstances, either about D, E,
or F; or, ascending an octave, which was his most
frequent custom, he could use it with facility, and
execute in it ornaments of a certain class with volubility
and sweetness. His shake was good, and his
intonation much more correct than is common to
singers so imperfectly educated. His pronunciation
of words, however, was thick, coarse, and vulgar.
His forte was ballad; and ballad not of the modern
cast of whining or rant or sentiment, but the original,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
manly, energetic strain of an earlier and better age
of English poesy and English song-writing: such
as "Black-eyed Susan," and "The Storm," the
bold and cheering hunting-song, or the love-song of
Shield, breathing the chaste, simple grace of genuine
English melody.'</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />
<p>Nearly all accounts agree in saying that (notwithstanding
Incledon's own very decided opinion to the
contrary) he was no <em>actor</em>. Not even his friend and
biographer Parkes, the oboe-player, who, with Shield
the composer, lived much with Incledon, would allow
him to have possessed <em>this</em> merit. Indeed, the story
is told that when Incledon was on one occasion enraged
at hearing that, on the performance of one of
the oratorios at a certain cathedral, the bishop had
determined that neither Incledon nor any other <em>actor</em>
should sing in such a place, and on such an occasion,
Bannister said to our hero, with mock seriousness,
'Incledon, if I were you I should make him <em>prove
his words</em>.' Notwithstanding, however, Incledon's
obtuseness on some points, he must have possessed a
fund of genuine humour, as the following anecdote will
show: When he and the elder Mathews (who, by the
way, was singularly successful in imitating his friend,
notwithstanding their great difference in person) were
once playing together at Leicester, Incledon was
much in want of a drab suit in which to appear in
the character of 'Steady,' a Quaker; so, seeing a
portly member of the Society of Friends, a druggist,
standing at his shop-door, Incledon entered, consumed
some quack medicine or other, and laid his hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
case before the Quaker. This he did with such admirable
tact that he actually succeeded in persuading
the good-natured druggist not only to lend him the
desired clothes, but also to appear secretly (against
his convictions, of course) at the performance.
Truth, however, compels me to add that the roguish
songster's success was partly due to his unblushing
statement that he and his family were themselves
formerly Quakers!</p>

<p>Incledon used also, during Lent, to appear in
oratorio, though apparently not with so much
success as in performances of secular music. He
was not so vain of his own voice as not to be very
fond of concerted vocal music. His singing of 'All's
Well' with Braham may perhaps be remembered by
a few who are still alive; but probably all those who
heard Incledon at the old 'Glee Club,' singing with
Shield, Johnstone, Bannister the elder, Dignum, C.
Ashley, and Parkes, have 'gone over to the majority.'
The jolly fellows used to meet every alternate Sunday
night at the Garrick's Head Coffee House, in
Bow Street.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>He retired from Covent Garden in 1815&mdash;when he
took a parting benefit at the Italian Opera House;
but, like so many other public favourites, he made
several 'last appearances' on the boards: one of
the really last ones being at Southampton, where he
commenced his career as a singer.</p>

<p>During the summer months, when the theatre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
was closed, and, indeed, during most of the latter
part of his career, it was Incledon's practice to visit
the provinces, giving entertainments, one of which
he called 'Variety,' and the other 'The Wandering
Melodist,' very much after the style of Dibdin's; and
for the nonce styling himself also 'The Wandering
Melodist.' It will be readily understood that these
performances were highly appreciated in the days
when locomotion was so much more difficult than it
is nowadays, and when to have 'been to London'
was the exception rather than the rule. It was
probably on one of these occasions that H. C. Robinson
fell in with him, on the top of a coach, and thus
records his impressions, in his diary of 4th April,
1811. After noting that Incledon was just the man
he expected to find him, with seven rings on his
fingers, five seals on his watch-ribbon, and a gold
snuff-box in his pocket, Robinson goes on to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'I spoke in terms of rapture of Mrs. Siddons.
He replied, "Ah! Sally's a fine creature. She has
a charming place on the Edgware Road. I dined
with her last year, and she paid me one of the finest
compliments I ever received. I sang "The Storm"
after dinner. She cried and sobbed like a child.
Taking both my hands, she said. "All that I and my
brother ever did, is nothing compared with the effect
you produce!"" Incledon spoke with warmth, and
apparent knowledge, of Church music, praising
Purcell especially, and mentioning Luther's simple
hymns. I was forced to confess that <em>I</em> had no ear
for music; and he, in order to try me, sang in a sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of song-whisper some melodies, which I certainly
enjoyed more, I thought, than anything I had heard
from him on the stage.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>But in order to show that Incledon did not himself
exaggerate the effect which the fire of his
manner and the sweetness of his singing sometimes
produced, let the following story testify. William
Robson, in the 'Old Playgoer,' says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'I remember when the <em>√©lite</em> of taste, science, and literature
were assembled to pay the well-deserved compliment
of a dinner to John Kemble, and to present
him with a handsome piece of plate on his retirement.
Incledon, on being requested, sang, as his best song&mdash;on
what he, I am sure, considered a great, though
melancholy event&mdash;"The Storm." The effect was
sublime, the silence holy, the feeling intense; and,
while Talma was recovering from his astonishment,
Kemble placed his hand on the arm of the great
French actor, and said in an agitated, emphatic, yet
proud tone, "<em>That</em> is an English singer."' Munden
adds that Talma jumped up from his seat, and embraced
Incledon <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">√† la Fran√ßaise</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>A list of his favourite songs at these entertainments,
preserved at the British Museum, may
not be unacceptable, as showing the musical tastes
of the day; some of them are still sung occasionally,
but most are long since forgotten. The
songs in the 'Variety' entertainment, which was
in three acts, were an introductory recitation and
song entitled 'Variety;' 'The Thorn;' 'Jack Junk;'
'The Glasses Sparkle on the Board;' 'Black-eyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Susan;' 'The Post Captain;' 'Charming Kitty;'
'The Irish Phantasmagoria;' 'The Captive to his
Bird;' 'The Storm;' 'Inconstant Sue;' 'Irish Hunting-song;'
A new loyal and national song; 'The Maid
with the Bosom of Snow;' and, for a finale, 'Loud
let the merry, merry welkin sound.'</p>

<p>'The Wandering Melodist' comprised: 'The
Married Man;' 'Patrick O'Stern;' 'The Farmer's
Treasure;' 'Mr. Mullins and Miss Whack;' 'Mad
Tom;' 'The Despairing Damsel;' 'The Sea-Boy on
the Giddy Mast' (which, by the way, must have
reminded him of old times); 'Fortune's Wheel;'
'Tom Moody;' 'The Siege;' 'Sally Roy;' 'Mariner's
Compass;' 'Hail to the Beam of Morning;' 'The
Italian Count and English Captain;' 'The Finale; or
The Rose, Shamrock, and Thistle.'</p>

<p>Incledon's last benefit at Drury Lane&mdash;when Elliston
engaged him in 1820, at ¬£15 a week&mdash;is said to
have brought him ¬£1,000; but, as we have seen,
towards the latter part of his career he did not often
appear in London, and on 8th October, 1824, he
sang, for the last time in public, at Southampton.
His voice was observed to falter as he sang the final
verse of 'Then Farewell my trim-built Wherry;' and
he thus took leave of his audience:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'Ladies and Gentlemen,&mdash;It is with the sincerest
feelings of gratitude that I acknowledge this evening
the distinguished favour you have ever conferred upon
me. In this town, and on these boards, I first
appeared as a singer; and the encouragement I then
received from you was, I may say, the passport to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
my fame. Since that time I have passed through
many vicissitudes. I have served His Majesty in
many engagements: there is not a ship in the navy,
nor many towns in the country, that I have not sung
in; but still your early liberality has never been
effaced from my memory. It is now six years ago
since I left the stage, but it has always been my wish
to appear once more before you. Age, sickness, and
infirmities have altered me much from what I once
was, but I have always done my best to please; and,
I repeat it, while I live I shall never forget the kindly
support I have received from the inhabitants of
Southampton.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Another authority (Donaldson) adds that on this
occasion Incledon also referred to his darling wives,
saying: 'I have had three&mdash;the first was the sainted
Jane [Miss Lowther, of Bath]; the second the angel
Mary [Miss Howell, of Bath&mdash;she died May, 1811];
and the third, still living, is the divine Martha.'<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>It will be seen that each of the entertainments
referred to above consisted of fifteen songs, and must
have taxed the singer's powers severely. I was a
little surprised at not finding either 'The Heaving of
the Lead,' or 'My bonny, bonny Bet, sweet Blossom,'
on either list; for the latter especially was a great
favourite, and Incledon always had to sing it twice,
often three times; but probably this was the very
reason why he omitted it from these programmes.</p>

<p>I have not been able to put my hand upon more
than one example of his talents as a composer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
namely, a song called 'Soft as the Morning's blushing
Hue,' which he used to sing in 'Family Quarrels'
(but Shield used to say that Incledon generally
managed to improve <em>his</em> composition). The song
mentioned above is a rather pretty, flowing melody,
eminently adapted to the remarkable compass and
flexibility of Incledon's voice; there is a copy of it at
the British Museum, with the initials 'C.I.,' in faded
ink, sprawling over the first page. And here it may
be well to observe that having added 'Charles' to
his Christian name Benjamin, he at length dropped
the latter name altogether.</p>

<p>Incledon did not confine his musical experiences
to England; but occasionally made trips to Ireland,
where 'no singer was ever more caressed.'</p>

<p>R. W. Procter, in his 'Manchester in Holiday
Dress,' says: 'When Incledon was returning home
from Dublin, on one occasion, the vessel in which he
embarked was upset in passing the bar. Several of the
passengers were drowned, but the singer saved himself
by climbing, in sailor fashion, to the round top,
with his wife lashed to him; Incledon all the while
uttering a strange mixture of oaths, prayers, and
confessions. They remained in that perilous position
for several hours, until rescued by some fishermen.'</p>

<p>Once, towards the close of his career, when his
powers, enfeebled by his careless manner of life, were
on the wane, he even ventured across the Atlantic.
In America, however (notwithstanding that a writer
in the <cite>New Monthly Magazine</cite>, for 1838, asserts that
he made ¬£5,000 by this trip), he is said to have been
a failure; though Incledon himself would insist upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
it, to the last, that his want of success there was
merely an example of the caprice of the public.</p>

<p>On his return to England he went to Brighton,
where, by a slight attack of paralysis, he received
his first warning that his career was nearly closed.
The 11th of February, 1826, found him, now sixty-four
years old, at Worcester, organizing one of his
entertainments. Here he attended a meeting of
a local glee-club, but declined, for some reason, to
take his part in the music. At his inn, however,
'The Reindeer,' he did sing in the kitchen<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>&mdash;to
gratify the servants&mdash;his last song:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Then farewell, my trim-built wherry!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Coat, and oars, and badge, farewell!'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">and a few nights afterwards, on the 19th February,
he bade farewell to a world which had often hung
upon his lips for the sweetest and manliest strains
that any English singer had ever warbled forth.
'The hunting-song, the sea-song, and the ballad,'
observes C. R. Leslie, in his autobiography, 'may be
said to have expired with Incledon.'</p>

<p>All contemporary accounts agree as to his vocal
merits. Parkes says that in twenty-four years he
never knew Incledon sing out of tune: indeed, it
has been observed that he <em>could</em> not have done so if
he had tried, for whilst his ear was marvellously
accurate, his knowledge of music was slight. Parkes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
speaks of his friend's memory being quick and retentive,
for melodies; but Incledon seems to have had
the greatest difficulty in recollecting any 'part;' and
more than once, when he had forgotten it, he has
been known to give an impromptu turn to the dialogue
in order to introduce some ballad appropriate
to the occasion, whilst cudgelling his brains for the
lost 'cue.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The few glimpses we have had of his private
character do not prepare us to expect much elegance
or refinement in Incledon, off or on the stage.
Indeed, it must be confessed that he was vain,
coarse, irritable at times, and dissipated; but he had
the redeeming traits of frankness and generosity;
and allowances must be made for his having lived in
'three-bottle' days. Cyrus Redding tells an amusing
story of Incledon's having been invited to a dinner
at 'The Pope's Head' Inn, Plymouth, in order that he
might be induced to entertain the company afterwards.
The wine of course circulated freely, and
Incledon, as was his wont, freely partook of it. He
attempted a recitation of the lines from 'Samson
Agonistes,' beginning 'Total eclipse!' but the good
cheer had proved too much for his wits, his head
sank upon his shoulders, and he became for a time
totally eclipsed himself:&mdash;he had been 'dining out'
daily, for a week before. It was, however (though
he drank hard), very rarely that he succumbed like
this. And Fitz Ball (Edward Ball)&mdash;who, by the
way, mentions that latterly Incledon got very fat&mdash;tells
a story which may be fitly inserted here. Being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
once at Bury St. Edmund's, whilst some military
ball was going on, Incledon, well in his cups,
said something to a young officer about 'featherbed
captains,' which the military hero chose to
regard as a personal affront, and accordingly, accompanied
by some friends (so the story goes),
besieged Incledon's room the next morning, and demanded
satisfaction. In the first place, there was
great difficulty about waking the singer from his
deep, vinous slumbers; and when at last he did
awake, he was quite at a loss to know why his
privacy had been invaded. On learning, however,
that 'satisfaction' was what was wanted, he sat up
in bed and sang, in his most exquisite manner,
'Black-eyed Susan,' so that there was at last not a
dry eye in the room. When he had finished, 'There,
my fine fellow!' said Incledon blandly, '<em>that</em> has
satisfied thousands&mdash;let it <em>satisfy</em> you;' and, putting
out his hand, it was as generously taken as it was
offered.</p>

<p>Some accounts give Incledon three wives, others
two; but those who are at all acquainted with the
history of the stage, seventy or eighty years ago,
will admit that this is a point upon which Incledon
himself might possibly not have been very clear.
There was one 'Mrs. Incledon,' however, who, like
the songster himself, was very fond of good living;
and there is a story that once, when Incledon was
entertaining at dinner, at his house, No. 13, Brompton
Crescent, his friend and medical adviser, Dr.
Moseley of Chelsea Hospital, and two or three
others, the dish of fish was artfully so arranged that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
a fine dory (to which the host and hostess were both
very partial) was completely overlaid by herrings;
and it was not until the guests had all been helped
to the humbler fish, that the gourmands' favourite
was&mdash;as if by accident&mdash;discovered. On this memorable
occasion we hear that 'pink <em>and</em> white champagne'
were handed round; that on its production,
the trio 'Beviamo tutte tre' was sung by Shield,
Parkes, and Incledon, with appropriate action; and
that, when the conversation turned upon the sort of
deaths which the Chelsea veterans died, Incledon,
delighted with Dr. Moseley's satisfactory account of
them, got up and persuaded all who were present to
join in singing Dr. Callcott's noble glee, 'Peace to the
Souls of the Heroes!'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Incledon, though he made plenty of money, was
often pecuniarily embarrassed, owing no doubt to
that 'lax and sailor-like twist of mind' which, as
Leigh Hunt says, always hung about him. An
instance of this occurs in a letter preserved among
the Egerton MSS., in which Incledon, writing to the
magniloquent George Robins, from Ipswich, in
February, 1816, tells how he had been arrested a few
days before, at Colchester, for ¬£19, by a Mr. Marriot
of Fleet Street, for the balance of a bill of over
¬£100. The singer had recently taken a house, and
had been put to great expense in furnishing it; and
his object in writing to Robins was to get him to
contradict, in London, the report that 'Incledon
was about to fly from the kingdom.' He adds that
he was then going on to Norwich, Aberdeen, Edinburgh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and Dublin, and finishes by saying that his
wife was with him, and that his being 'arrested has
given my Poor Little Woman so great a Shock that
she will not soon get over. She is now very Ill, and
continually in Tears.' He nevertheless was supposed<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
to have been worth ¬£8,000 when he died, leaving
this third wife a widow with three children. He
was buried in Hampstead churchyard, on the 20th
February, 1826, aged sixty-four, by the side of his
first and second wives, and five of their children.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So lived and so died Charley Incledon&mdash;'generous
as a prince,' as Charles Mathews wrote of him,
'never ashamed of his antecedents;' and as Dowton
says,</p>

<p class="center small">'Unrivalled in his native minstrelsy.'</p>

<p>One of his sons, Charles, who had been unsuccessful
as a farmer near Bury St. Edmund's, attempted,
under Braham's auspices, to succeed as a
singer: he made his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d√©but</i> either as Hawthorn in
'Love in a Village,' or as Young Meadows, at
Covent Garden, on the 3rd October, 1829; but in
this attempt, too, the poor fellow (who had a large
family, and who had, moreover, a strong objection
to the stage on moral and religious grounds) failed.
Another son, Frank, became a well-to-do London
tradesman; and a daughter married well, and settled
in Sunderland.</p>

<p class="drop-capi2"><span class="smcap">A little</span> ploughed field in the parish
of St. Erme, about five miles north of
Truro, on a farm still called Killigrew, is
the site of the old residence of this distinguished
family. Their place knows them no
more; and even their own name is, with the sole
exception just referred to, and in one or two instances
where it appears as a Christian name of
some of their remote descendants, 'clean blotted out.'
Yet it was once&mdash;as the old Cornish word implies&mdash;'a
grove of eagles'; for we shall find that their race
soared high, and produced examples of each of the
distinguished classes noted above; and that their
memory is worthy of their tombs in Westminster
Abbey, and of a local monument&mdash;the pyramid which
one who married into the family and assumed the
name, in the latter part of the seventeenth century,
erected at Falmouth in 1737-38.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>There is some reason to believe that the family
was of royal descent. The first of the name whom
I have been able to trace, is one Ralph Killigrew,
said to have been a natural son of Richard, Earl of
Cornwall, and King of the Romans, by his concubine
Joan de Valletort. Hence, so it is said, the
double-headed spread eagle and the 'border bezanty'
of the family arms.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Henry, Otho, Simon, Thomas,
John, and Maugan are other Christian names of
very early Killigrews.</p>

<p>Lysons gives the following instances of their being at
an early date possessors of lands in Cornwall: John de
Killigrew, of Killigrew, had ¬£20 a year or more in land
in 1297; Henry de Killigrew held a military feu in
Orchard Marries (? Marrais) in the hundred of Stratton
in 3rd Henry IV. (1402); Rad. de Killigrew held
a 'feod. parv.' at some place in the hundred of
Powder; Henry, son of Maugi de Killigrew, had a
similar tenure in Trewyn, in the same hundred&mdash;and
they retained the Manor of Killigrew till 1636, so
Lysons says. I may add, as an early instance of the
name being mentioned, that there was a Richard (or
Michael) Killigrew, one of a riotous lot of junior
scholars at Merton College, Oxon, about the year
1350.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>
<p>After the lapse of about a century and a half from
the time of Ralph, one of the Killigrews married the
heiress of Arwenack, near Falmouth&mdash;a lady of
broad lands, for her estates extended, it is said, from
Arwenack (an old Cornish name which is said to
signify either 'the beloved, still cove,' or 'upon the
marsh') to the mouth of the Helford river, a distance
along the coast of some five or six miles. To this
place, overlooking the beautiful waters of Falmouth
Haven, then a deeper and far more important harbour
than it is at present, the Killigrew of the day,
Simon by name, moved from his ancestral abode in
St. Erme sometime during the reign of Richard II.,
probably about 1385; and here the Killigrews
remained for nearly four centuries, acting as
governors of Pendennis Castle for a great part of
that period, intermarrying with many of the oldest
Cornish families, and attending at the Courts of
Henry VIII., Elizabeth, the first and second James,
the first and second Charles, and William III.&mdash;loyal,
able, and trusted adherents.</p>

<p>The earliest monument to any member of the
family is, so far as I can ascertain, the brass in
Gluvias Church, near Penryn, to Thomas Killigrew
and his two wives Joan and Elizabeth, and all their
children.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> On the brass Thomas Killigrew is described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
as a gentleman ('generosus'); he is represented
in the costume of the latter part of the fifteenth
century, in a long handsome robe trimmed with fur,
and carries on his right shoulder his hat, after the
fashion of the time&mdash;a wealthy merchant, in all probability.
Thus far and no further, I regret to say,
can I trace anything of interest respecting the early
Killigrews.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But we now approach comparatively modern
times, and are soon bewildered by the number of
more or less illustrious names from which to select
examples. A genealogical table, which I compiled
for my guidance, offers at least fifty names not unknown
in history, and of whose possessors accounts,
not without interest, might be given.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> But to do this
would be to write a book instead of a chapter; and
a far smaller number must suffice.</p>

<p>The Killigrew family seems naturally to divide itself
into two classes, roughly speaking, complementary
to each other: viz., the elder branch, which was
on the whole the steadier and the more prosperous,
whose present representative (by marriage) is the
Earl of Kimberley, Secretary of State for India;
and the younger branch (now also extinct in the
male line) more fertile than the former in statesmen,
soldiers, and wits. This division it is proposed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>adopt in the following notices of both branches of
the family.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Seniores priores.</i> Let us commence with the first
John Killigrew, of importance, upon record. His
brass, like that of the first Thomas, is to be found in
another little village church&mdash;St. Budock by name&mdash;near
Falmouth. Evidently a grim warrior, covered
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cap-√†-pied</i> with plate armour, and associated in the representation
with his wife&mdash;one of another good old
Cornish family (now also extinct)&mdash;Elizabeth, daughter
of James Trewinnard of St. Erth. This John was a
rich man, his estate being worth no less than ¬£6,000
a year; and he was the first Captain of Pendennis
Castle, built on his own ground, under his own
superintendence, and with the co-operation of
Thomas Treffry of Place (who, by the way, married
Elizabeth Killigrew, John's sister), in the reign of
our castle-building King, Henry VIII. The same
John Killigrew was appointed in 1551, together with
Sir William Godolphin and Francis Godolphin, to
survey the Islands of Scilly, and to build a fort
there; no doubt that which stands on St. Mary's
Isle, and is now known as Elizabeth Castle, with its
inscription, 'E.R. 1593,' over the principal entrance.
He was, moreover, sheriff for the county, and in
that capacity wrote a letter, dated at Truro, to
Cardinal Wolsey, on the subject of a threatened
French invasion. Not content with building a
castle for his King, John built (or rather rebuilt) for
himself (about 1571, according to Hals), Arwenack
House, in such a style that it was reputed the finest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and most costly in the county at that time. Little
did he think that one of his descendants was to see
it almost entirely destroyed, either by Waller, or by
the owner himself, to prevent its falling into the
enemy's hand, nearly a century later. Some part of
the structure still stands, and is used as a manor-office;
and here is preserved a conjectural restoration
of Arwenack House in its long-since-departed glory.</p>

<p>To him succeeded his son, Sir John Killigrew,
Knight, as second captain of the fortress. I find
nothing further recorded of him, save that he
married one Mary Wolverston,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and that when he
died on the 5th March, 1584, he too was buried at
St. Budock.</p>

<p>His son John&mdash;third of the name&mdash;seems to have
been, according to some contemporary accounts,
a man of no very high character; in fact, he has
been stigmatized as 'a pirate,' an 'avoider of his
debts,' 'a gamester,' and 'spendthrift.' Amongst
the Lansdowne MSS., in the British Museum,
are preserved accounts of his misconduct. One,
dated 7th March, 1588/9, is a 'Complaynte against
John Killigrew of y<sup>e</sup> County of Cornwall, of many of
his ill demeners.' First comes a list of his 'knowen
debtes' to Her Majesty and others. Then the
document sets forth that, notwithstanding many
judgments obtained against him, he 'satisfieth no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
man;' but rides abroad, attended by armed servants,
defies the bailiffs, and commits all sorts of high-handed
irregularities. It concludes with the statement
that he endeavours to satisfy his wealthier
creditors with vain promises, and the poorer ones
with blows and threatening words; and in fact, the
complainants say it would require 'a hole quire of
pap<sup>r</sup>' to sum up all his misdeeds. His boarding and
pillaging a Danish ship, and some similar acts of
violence, are set forth by Sir Julius C√¶sar in other
documents of this series; and our hero, together
with one William Ewens, are set down as 'notorious
pirates.' That he did not obtain the honour
of knighthood under such circumstances is hardly to
be wondered at.</p>

<p>I cannot, however, help thinking that he has been
debited with many of the misdeeds of one Peter Killigrew,
who lived a century before him, but whose exact
connexion with the family I have been unable to trace
satisfactorily. Perhaps the one mentioned in Strype's
'Memorials of Edward VI.,' of whom it is observed,
in 1552, that one 'Strangwich' (? Restronguet), 'and
two Killigrews with him, were such notable sea-rovers,
that, in the month of February of that year,
the King sent a letter to the French King, that he
would do his endeavour for the apprehension of
them.' And yet, in 1592, a Mr. Killigrew, according
to the same authority, was appointed, at Sir Walter
Raleigh's request, on a commission to inquire into
the matter of the distribution of the spoil of a
certain richly-laden Spanish carrack, '<i>The Mother of
God</i>' taken by some of Sir Walter's ships on her return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
from the East Indies. Indeed, there is considerable
difficulty in identifying some of the Killigrews of the
sixteenth and early in the seventeenth centuries.
But the fact is, that not only were the Killigrews
concerned in exploits of this nature, but there were
many others amongst the west-countrymen who,
under Sir Peter Carew, slipped over to France, and
did a little privateering against Spain on their own
account, being anxious to do all in their power to
prevent the marriage of Mary with Philip of Spain.
A Killigrew of this date had three ships under his
command, according to the Calais MSS. 'Wild
spirits of all nations,' says Froude&mdash;'Scots, English,
French, whoever chose to offer&mdash;found service under
their flag. They were the first specimens of the
buccaneering chivalry of the next generation, the
germ out of which rose the Drakes, the Raleighs,
the Hawkinses, who harried the conquerors of the
New World.' Ultimately the Godolphins and Killigrews
were threatened with prosecution, but nothing
came of it. By his wife Dorothy, daughter of
Thomas Monck of Potheridge, Devon, John is said
to have had nine sons and five daughters, though I
can only trace ten children altogether. She was the
sister of General Monck, Duke of Albemarle, whose
exploits on behalf of his royal masters, and especially
the prominent part he took in the restoration of
Charles II., are well-known matters of history. I
have referred somewhat more fully to this in the
chapter on the Grenvilles.</p>

<p>This John (whom we have called the third) had
two brothers, Thomas and Simon, both of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
were Court favourites. Some other Cornish gentlemen
of the time seem to have been equally popular
with the Queen, as Elizabeth said of them that they
were all 'born courtiers, and with a becoming confidence.'
Queen Elizabeth sent Thomas on an
embassy to the Count Palatine of the Rhine; and
I find that he was also commissioned to seize a
certain ship of Brittany at 'Pensans' (Penzance),
and to 'distribute the spoil among such as by
certain Britaines have been heretofore spoiled of
their goods and wronged.' Rough and ready justice
this, seemingly, and a lesson from which some subsequent
Killigrews, as we shall find, did not fail to take
a hint. John's younger brother, Simon, was, to some
extent, a herald, as appears by a letter from him on the
subject of the Manaton coat of arms, preserved
amongst the Harleian MSS. (1079), in the British
Museum. The two younger brothers added to the
family estates by purchases of a property, with a
town-house at Lothbury; a country seat at Kineton
(? Kempton) Park, near Hampton Court; besides
sundry lands and manors in East Cornwall, Devon,
and Lincolnshire. Of their two sisters, Mary and
Katherine, I can learn nothing, except that the
latter married twice.</p>

<p>To return, therefore, to the main line&mdash;Sir John,
the fourth and last of that name (for Sir William,
the eldest son, who was made a baronet in 1661,
and was buried in Westminster Abbey in 1665,
would seem to have led an uneventful life, and
need not detain us), was knighted at Whitehall
on 8th November, 1617; he was 'a good, sober<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
man,' and was likewise, I fancy, a Captain of
Pendennis. He seems, moreover, to have been the
chief promoter, at great pecuniary loss, of the first
beacon-light on the Lizard, for which he obtained a
patent from King James I., in 1619.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> But he had
the misfortune to marry an unsuitable partner&mdash;Jane,
the daughter of Sir George Fermor&mdash;about
whom Hals tells the following story (the credibility
of which Davies Gilbert thought was at least questionable;
but the tradition is still locally extant).<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Towards the close of Elizabeth's reign, two Dutch
ships of the Hanse Towns League, and therefore
under special protection, sailed into Falmouth Harbour,
driven there either by the Spaniards or by
stress of weather. They had scarcely arrived before
Dame Killigrew, accompanied by some ruffians,
boarded the Dutch ships, slew the owners, and seized
two hogsheads of pieces of eight, which she took 'for
her own use.' This high-handed proceeding of course
produced remonstrances on the part of the rightful
proprietors of the money, and led to the trial, conviction,
and execution of all the offenders, save the lady
herself, at Launceston. She barely escaped, and not
without the utmost interest having been made for her
with the Queen by Sir John Arundell, of Tolverne,
and Sir Nicholas Hals, of Pengerswick.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only irregularity for which the
authorities of Pendennis were complained of. In 1631
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>the Castle guns were fired upon the King's ships!
and on the 2nd November in that year a Captain
Kettleby writes thus: 'None disturb the free trade
in those parts more than the Captain of Pendennis
Castle&mdash;he is at peace with neither King's ships, nor
others&mdash;both the Admiral and the writer have been
twice shot at by him in going in and out. The last
shot fell in the town of St. Mawes, but only hurt one
woman.' Possibly the explanation of such apparently
wanton mischief as this is to be found in the
rivalry which existed for precedence between the
two castles, Pendennis and St. Mawes, on opposite
sides of the harbour mouth&mdash;a rivalry so intense as
to have finally rendered a compromise indispensable.</p>

<p>Whether the details of the story of Dame Mary, or
Dame Jane (an 'old Jezebel,' as her enemies called her)
be true or not; whether it be a distorted reproduction
of some of the misdeeds of her father-in-law, the third
John; or whether the real cause of the misunderstanding
between her husband and her faithless self
was the now fast-growing rivalry between the ports of
Penryn and Falmouth&mdash;this much at least is certain:
that in the year 1633 Dame Jane gave to the mayor
of 'Permarin,' and his successors in office for ever, a
handsome silver chalice, still used as a loving-cup at
the mayor-choosings, on which it is recorded that
the Penryn mayor succoured her when she was 'in
greate miserie.'<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The unhappy pair were divorced,
without issue; the husband dying in 1632 or 1636,
and his wife twelve years afterwards.</p>

<p>A few words may be added here on the subject of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the harbour. Penryn, the more ancient port, lies at
the head of a long, tortuous creek; more secure,
doubtless, from its position, and its once stockaded
channel, from an enemy's ships than Falmouth was
before the erection of Pendennis and St. Mawes
Castles; and to Truro the same remark applied with
still greater force. The rivalry between the two
more ancient ports, Penryn and Truro, and the comparatively
modern Falmouth, was, as may be supposed,
of the keenest; but the natural advantages
of Falmouth&mdash;at length defended by two forts, and
aided by the powerful interest of the Killigrews&mdash;prevailed;
and Falmouth, too, became 'a port.' A
town&mdash;now one of the largest, busiest, and gayest of
the quiet towns of Cornwall&mdash;accordingly sprang up
around the once lonely site of Arwenack.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Failing issue of the eldest brother, Sir William,
the first baronet&mdash;and also of Sir John&mdash;Sir Peter,
first knight of that name, now becomes the representative
of this, the elder branch of the family:
'a merry youth, bred under the Earl of Bristol,'
says one authority&mdash;and known as 'Peter the Post,'
as another tells us, from the alacrity with which he
despatched 'like wild-fire' all the messages and other
commissions entrusted to him in the King's cause.
On him was laid the important duty of conveying from
Oxford the King's proposals to the Parliament
in January, 1645. Like Rupert himself, he seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
have been in perpetual motion; and on one occasion,
during 'Oliver's usurpation,' Sir Peter rode from
Madrid, through France, and having passed the sea,
got to London in seven days. Like Sir Tristram in
the 'Monks and Giants,'</p>

<p class="center small">'From realm to realm he ran, and never staid.'</p>

<p class="noind">He was one of those who very nearly succeeded, it is
said, in enabling Charles I. to effect his escape into
France; and it was in his time that (as it is said) in
revenge for his attachment to the Stuart cause, the
mansion of Arwenack was ruined by Waller during the
memorable operations of the siege in the time of the
Civil War. It is, however, not improbable that its destruction
was commenced by its patriotic owner in
order to prevent its occupation by the enemy. Pendennis
was the last castle (except Raglan) which
held out for the King's cause;<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> but on the 16th
August, 1646, it too was forced to surrender (though
with flying colours, and all the honours of war) to
Fairfax, after a terrible five months of siege 'and
famine and harsh wounds,' endured gallantly by old
John Arundell of Trerice, then nearly eighty years of
age.</p>

<p>The author of these verses, after the surrender,
significantly, and not unnecessarily, added the ensuing

<p>The family estates, worth, at one time, ¬£6,000 a
year, had sadly dwindled away by the time they came
into the second Sir Peter's possession; indeed, they
are said to have been worth no more than about ¬£80
a year; yet he contrived to become elected M.P.
for Camelford, and by 1630 had married Mary, the
sister of Lord Lucas, of Colchester, Earl Pembroke
giving the marriage portion of 'a good ¬£300 a
year;' and the <cite>Mercurius Politicus</cite> for 15th March,
1660, informs us that in that month he was
made Governor of Pendennis by General Monk.
This Sir Peter continued, like his predecessors, a
sturdy champion of Falmouth. He got the Custom
House removed from its old place at Penryn, to his
own more modern town; carved the parish of Falmouth
out of that of St. Budock (15 Charles II.);
and, with the assistance of the King and others, built
and endowed the church, dedicated to the memory
of King Charles the martyr,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> where his own bones
first, and then those of other Killigrews after him,
were laid. Some accounts give 1670 as the date
of his death; others say&mdash;probably more accurately&mdash;that
he died on the road to Exeter, in 1667:
possibly killed on one of his break-neck rides; for,
as we have seen, he was a man of no common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
energy and daring. He left three children: Peter,
William, and Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Of the sister it seems unnecessary to say more than
that she married a Count de Kinski, a title which, I
believe, still survives. William, who died unmarried
in 1678, became a soldier of fortune, and ultimately
a general officer; and he was commander-in-chief of
some Danish forces, sent by the Spaniards against
the Swedes. After one of his successful engagements,
he sold certain captured horses (his share
of the spoil) to His Majesty of Denmark for some
¬£3,000. But failing to get his money from his
royal employer, the general executed the military
movement known as 'right-about-face,' and transferred
his sword to the Dutch, by whom his valour
was more honourably rewarded. I have failed to
trace the details of his career; but he seems to
have been recalled to England at the Restoration,
and had a regiment of foot. His nephew succeeded
to his estate, which Martin Lister says was 'composed
more of honour than of substance.'</p>

<p>It is, however, with the elder son of this generation
that we have chiefly to deal, for through him
the succession was kept up. Sir Peter, the second
baronet (inheriting that title from his uncle, the
foregoing Sir William, the first), was born in 1634,
and was educated, notwithstanding his father's reduced
estate, first at Oxford, and afterwards in France.
Whilst he was at Oxford, the horrible execution of
Anne Green, for murdering her infant illegitimate
child, took place. After hanging for half an hour,
she recovered her life in consequence of judicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
medical treatment; and full particulars of the event
are given in a rare little volume published at Oxford
in 1651, and entitled 'News from the Dead.' To
this work many of the members of the university
contributed short sets of verses, some in Latin, some
in English. The following lines were those supplied
by the Cornish baronet:</p>

<p>In 1662, Sir Peter, who had been made Governor
of Pendennis on the Restoration, married the handsome,
virtuous, and accomplished Frances Twysden,
daughter of Sir Roger, the well-known judge of that
name;<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and the union appears to have been a happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
one in every respect, save as to the offspring. Peter,
the eldest, died young; George, the second son, was
killed in a tavern brawl at Penryn (at the house of a
Mr. Chalons, says Tonkin), by 'a stab in the back'
from a barrister named Walter Vincent. Another
account states that the skull, which was found in
1861, showed that the hole made by the rapier was
clearly visible in the forehead. Frances, the elder
daughter, married a Cornish gentleman named
Richard Erissey,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> who 'cast her off' three years
after their marriage. Ann, the youngest, who died
without issue, married Martin Lister, a Staffordshire
gentleman and soldier of fortune, who assumed the
name of Killigrew, and managed the estates for
many years. Clearly the main stem of the great
race of Killigrew was rapidly decaying!</p>

<p>On the death, or murder, of his son George, old
Sir Peter, who had gone to live at Arwenack in
1670, disappointed at having no male issue, and
sick of the innumerable squabbles in which he found
himself involved with the Falmouth folk, retired,
first to London, and then, in 1697, to Ludlow,
where he passed his time in scientific pursuits of a
speculative character, the results of which appear to
have died with him. His portrait, by Sir Godfrey
Kneller, now in the possession of Mrs. Boddam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Castle, of Grove House, Clifton (a descendant of
the Killigrews), fully harmonizes with what we know
of his character. One practical thing, however, he
did: viz., to build the public quay at Falmouth; and
to that old town, endeared to him by so many pleasant
memories of the past, were his remains conveyed
to be interred in the parish church, among
those of his more immediate ancestors. The monuments
are not, at present, to be seen; perhaps they
are hidden under the raised floor of the chancel:
but there were laid, in 1704, the remains of Sir Peter
Killigrew,&mdash;the last male in the main<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> line.</p>

<p>George, his son, though, as we have seen, he died
young, was not unmarried. He gained for his wife
an offshoot of another old Cornish family, Ann,
daughter of Sir John St. Aubyn, Bart., by whom he
had issue one daughter (Ann), married to a Major
John Dunbar. To the heiress of the ill-starred
Erissey match&mdash;Sir Peter's youngest grand-daughter,
Mary&mdash;the bulk of the remaining Killigrew property
seems to have descended; and through her the
present representative of the family (the Earl of
Kimberley) holds it. She married, in 1711, a Colonel
John West.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>There are few things more amusing in its way
than the account which Mr. R. N. Worth has preserved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>for us in the <cite>Journal of the Royal Institution
of Cornwall</cite>, of the arrangements which Martin Killigrew
(Lister) requested should be made for Colonel
West's reception at Arwenack. They are as
follows:</p>

to ye flurry you will be put in from his being a
person of great consideration as I hear, tho' I know
not so much as his name and as Little any particular

advised by the Col<sup>n</sup>. as to your providing accommodation
for their Retinue: Two bed chambers for ye

room for ye servants to Eat in: The best Cook your

James to provide; and if any fine green Tea<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> be to
be had, you must secure some of it, as what ye Col<sup>n</sup>.

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>It will be seen from the above that Martin was a
man of some mettle, and able to manage the affairs
of his stewardship adroitly, though far away from the
scene. He was always at war with the Corporation
of Falmouth, of which borough he was for some
time Recorder, and he died in St. James's Square,
London, on 7th March, 1745.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the latest notices of any member of the
family that I have met with, one is contained in the
sprightly pages of Mrs. Delany's 'Life and Correspondence;'
the subject of her remarks seems to
have been a true Killigrew, at least so far as his
dramatic talent affords any indication. On the
26th January, 1752, at Mr. Bushe's (near Dublin),
at a dinner-party, she met a Mr. Killigrew, who
was 'a very entertaining, charming man, well-bred,
good-humoured, and sings in a most extraordinary
manner; has a fine voice, fine taste, no
knowledge of music, but the exactest imitation of
Senesino and Monticelli that you can imagine. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
sings French songs incomparably, with so much
humour that in spite of my gloom he made me laugh
heartily.'</p>

<p>Of another, the last male of his name, Thomas
Guildford Killigrew, I find from <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>,
1873, p. 224, and also from other sources, including
information<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> with which I have been favoured by
Mrs. Boddam Castle, that he married Miss Catharine
Chubb, a distant relative, after having much
impoverished himself in the Stuart cause in 1745,
and that he settled in Bristol for the sake of
economy. He died in 1782 without issue. At his
death Mrs. Killigrew adopted her great niece, Mary
Iago, afterwards married to Daniel Wait, Mayor of
Bristol, in 1805. On the death of Mrs. Killigrew, in
1810, the family plate and portraits (one of the
latter, Sir Peter Killigrew, by Sir Godfrey Kneller,
and another, of Thomas Guildford Killigrew himself)
passed to Mrs. Wait by will, and from her to Mrs.
Boddam Castle, wife of Mr. Boddam Castle, barrister-at-law,
now residing at Clifton. Some of the
plate is more than 150 years old; the crest a demi-griffin,
with 'T.C.K.' over it.</p>

<p>The last who bore the surname of Killigrew
was Frances Maria (daughter of George Augustus
Killigrew, of Bond Street), who died in Portman
Street, London, on 20th July, 1819, aged seventy-one.</p>

<p>And here let us pause, after having exhausted (so
far as I am aware) all the sources of information, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
having, I believe, at least set down all that was noteworthy,
of the <em>elder</em> branch of the Killigrews.</p>

<hr class="r15" />
<p class="pfs120"><em>THE SECOND BRANCH.</em></p>

<p class="noind">John Killigrew, the first Captain of Pendennis,
had three brothers, James, Thomas, and Bennet, of
whom I can learn nothing of interest. And he also
had other sons than John the second knight, his
successor at Pendennis Castle, of whom we have
already heard. One son&mdash;Thomas&mdash;died young.
Another, the fourth son, was the famous Sir Henry
Killigrew, Knight, who sat as Member of Parliament
for Launceston in 1552-53, and for Truro about
twenty years later. Him let us take as our first
representative of the younger branch of the family.
He is described as a Teller of the Exchequer, Commander
of 'Newhaven' (Nieuwport), and Ambassador
to Germany, France (where he temporarily
relieved Sir Francis Walsingham), Scotland, the
Palatinate, Frankfort, and the Low Countries.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
Of a man of such mark&mdash;one whom Emerson would
have called 'a bright personality'&mdash;traces would assuredly
be forthcoming; and we do not seek them
in vain amongst the Lansdowne, the Cottonian,
the Egerton, and the 'Additional' Manuscripts in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
British Museum; amongst the Scotch MSS.; and in
the Public Record Office. Moreover, the Yelverton
MSS. contain references to him, as also do the collections
in Lambeth Palace Library. Most of these
are Letters, Instructions, and Memorials, referring to
the diplomatic functions which he was called upon
to discharge, and partaking rather too much of the
'Dryasdust' character to be interesting to the
general reader. There are some verses by him to
'My Ladye Cecylle' (his wife's sister), preserved in
the Cambridge University Library; but I propose to
omit these in favour of some Latin lines addressed to
the same lady by Sir Henry's wife; not only because
of the courteous maxim, '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place aux dames</i>,'
but also because the lady's verses are really charming.
In lieu of any specimen of Sir Henry's <em>poetic</em> vein,
an extract from a letter which he wrote from Edinburgh,
on 6th October, 1572, descriptive of John
Knox&mdash;towards the close of his life&mdash;and some other
fragments of his prose, will probably be more acceptable.
'John Knox,' he says, 'is now so feeble as
scarce can he stand alone, or speak to be heard of
any audience, yet doth he every Sunday cause himself
to be carried to a place where a certain number
do hear him, and preacheth with the same vehemency
and zeal that ever he did.' This account is
fully confirmed by another contemporary description
of him, which is so graphic that I cannot refrain
from giving it.</p>

<p>From May, 1571, to August, 1572, Knox lived in
St. Andrews, and frequently preached there. 'I
haid my pen and my little book,' says James Melville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
'and tuk away sic things as I could comprehend.
In the opening upe of his text he was
moderat the space of an halff houre; bot when he
enteret to application, he maid me sa to grew &amp;
tremble, that I could nocht hald a pen to wryt....
He was verie weak. I saw him everie day of his
doctrine go hulie and fear, with a furring of martriks
about his neck, a staff in the an hand, and
guid godlie Richart Ballanden, his servand, halding
upe the uther oxtar, from the Abbay to the paroche
kirk; and be the said Richart and another servant,
lifted upe to the pulpit, whar he behovit to lean at
his first entrie; bot or he haid done with his sermont,
he was sa active and vigorus that he was lyk to ding
that pulpit in blads, and fly out of it!' But his work
was nearly done; weary of the world, and 'thirsting
to depart,' in a few months he entered into his rest.</p>

<p>We learn of Sir Henry, from Heppe, that
Queen Elizabeth being very desirous of concluding
a sincere alliance, or 'Common League,'
between herself and the Evangelical Princes of the
Empire, sent to the Elector Palatine and other the
Electors of the Holy Roman Empire and the States,
Henry Killigrew&mdash;her 'approved and faithful servant'&mdash;and
her 'orator,' Dr. Mount, with a view to
counteracting 'the pernicious and sanguinary plots
of certain persons against all the professors of the
Holy Gospel in every place.' The Congress to
which they were accredited met at Frankfort, in
April, 1569, but Killigrew and Mount arrived too late
for it.</p>

<p>These, and other of his diplomatic missions are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
referred to in the following extract from a memorial
in Leonard Howard's 'Collection of Letters of
Princes, Great Personages, and Statesmen.' After
recounting his many<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> diplomatic missions for his
Queen to France, 'to discover theire intents there
against this Realme;' to Germany, 'to sound the
Princes of Germanye touching a League defensive
for Religion' (for which he had 'but Fortye Pounds
allowance for all manner of Chardges; which coste me
as muche more with the least'); and again several
times to those Countries, as well as to Scotland in
1573, and to Newhaven, where he was hurt and imprisoned&mdash;Sir
Henry thus concludes:</p>

<p>'Now for all these Journeys, Chardges, Daungers,
Hurtes and Losses, in the meanwhile, and the
Tyme used only in her Majesties' service, without
any Proffitt of my owne, I have only to lyve by, of
Her Majesties' Goodness, the Tellershippe, which
was given me before I went to Newehaven....' In
consideration of all which&mdash;by way of a provision
for his family&mdash;he prefers a 'Suite for the said
Firme of the Manor of Sarrake (?) in Cornwall  ...';
adding, 'The Rent is somewhat great, I confess;
but truly the Profitt nothinge equall.'</p>

<p>Let us hope that services so long, so faithful, and
so important, at length received their reward. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
they probably did may be surmised from the following
account of the close of his active career, given by
the Cornish historian Carew: 'After ambassades
and messages, and many other profitable employments
of peace and warre, in his prince's service, to
the good of his country, (Sir Henry Killigrew) hath
made choyce of a retyred estate, and, reverently regarded
by all sorts, placeth his principal contentment
in himselfe, which, to a life so well acted, can
no way bee wanting.'</p>

<p>Lord Burleigh's instructions to him,<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> on the subject
of his Scotch mission, written with his own
hand, dated 10th September, 1572, especially as to
getting Mary Queen of Scots out of the kingdom,
and delivering her to the Regent's party, form
a most interesting document. The letter closes
thus: 'Herein yow shall, as Comodite shall serve
yow, use all good Spede, with the most Secresy that
yow can, to understand their Mynds; <em>and yet so to
deale to your uttermost, that this Matter might be rather
Oppened to yow, than yourself to seme first to move
it</em>....'</p>

<p>Another object of his momentous mission to
Scotland, as to which Elizabeth gave him her instructions
with her own mouth, was to impress
upon Mary Queen of Scots a sense of her faults,
her duties, and her danger&mdash;a vain task! Froude
gives an account of the interview, which took place
after Darnley's murder. 'The windows at Holyrood
were half-closed, the rooms were darkened,
and in the profound gloom the English Ambassador<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
was unable to see the Queen's face, but by her
words she seemed very doleful.' And at length,
having extorted from her a promise that Bothwell
should be put upon his trial, Killigrew went back to
London in less than a week, after having carried out
his difficult and delicate duty 'like a loyal servant.'</p>

<p>The 'Cabala' states that when Henry Killigrew went
to France, he was considered 'in livelihood much
inferior to Walsingham;' but Leicester's opinion of
him was subjected to revision. He says he found
our hero 'a quicker and stouter fellow than he tooke
him for.' I have often wondered whether this impression
was derived from Sir Henry's bearing when the
question of his pay was mooted. '60/ a pece, per
dyem' had been set down, complains Leicester,
writing to Walsingham on 15th December, 1585, as
the pay of Killigrew and his colleague, whereas <em>he</em>
had understood it was to be only 40s. The Earl's
impression proved to be correct, and heart-burnings
doubtless arose; with what result I know not, but
Leicester's revised estimate of his man may point to
the event. Sir H. Killigrew was at the siege of
St. Quentin, in 1557; and Sir James Melville says
how he met at La Ferre (? La Frette) 'Maister
Hary Killygrew, an Englis gentleman, my auld
frend, wha held my horse till I sate down in ane
barbour's buith, to be pensit of the hurt in my head.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
He is found described, amongst the strangers
resident in London in 1595 ('Nichols' Collections,'
viii. 206), as living then in 'Broad Street Warde;'
and he died on the 16th March, 1602/3. The character
of this 'Admirable Crichton' has been so well
drawn by David Lloyd in his 'State Worthies,'
that I cannot refrain from giving it, in the words of
Whitworth's translation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'Travellers report, that the place wherein the body
of Absalom was buried is still extant at Jerusalem,
and that it is a solemn custome of pilgrims passing
by it to cast a stone on the place; but a well-disposed
man can hardly go by the memory of this worthy
person without doing grateful homage thereunto in
bestowing upon him one or two of our observations.</p>

<p>'It's a question sometimes whether diamond gives
more lustre to the ring it's set in, or the ring to the
diamond; this gentleman received honour from his
family, and gave renoun to it. Writing is the character
of the speech, as that is of the mind. From
Tully (whose orations he could repeat to his dying
day) he gained an even and apt stile, flowing at one
and the selfsame height. Tully's Offices, a book
which boys read, and men understand, was so
esteemed of my Lord Burleigh, that to his dying
day he always carried it about him, either in his
bosome or his pocket, as a compleat piece that, like
Aristotle's rhetorick, would make both a scholar and
an honest man. Cicero's magnificent orations against
Anthony, Catiline and Verres; C√¶sar's great Commentaries
that he wrote with the same spirit that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
fought; flowing Livy; grave, judicious and stately
Tacitus; eloquent, but faithful Curtius; brief and
rich Salust; prudent and brave Xenophon, whose
person was Themistocles his companion, as his book
was Scipio Affricanus his pattern in all his wars;
ancient and sweet Herodotus; sententious and
observing Thucidides; various and useful Polybius;
Siculus, Halicarnasseus, Trogus, Orosius, Justine,
made up our young man's retinue in all his travels
where (as Diodorus the Sicilian writes) he "<em>sate on
the stage of human life, observing the great circumstances
of places, persons, times, manners, occasions, etc, and was
made wise by their example who haue trod the path of
errour and danger before him</em>." To which he added
that grave, weighty and sweet Plutarch, whose books
(said Gaza) would furnish the world, were all others
lost. Neither was he amazed in the labyrinth of
history, but guided by the clue of cosmography, hanging
his study with maps, and his mind with exact
notices of each place. He made in one view a
judgement of the situation, interest, and commodities
(for want whereof many statemen and souldiers
have<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> failed) of nations; but to understand the
nature of places, is but a poor knowledge, unless
we know how to improue them by art; therefore
under the figures of triangles, squares, circles and
magnitudes, with their terms and bounds, he could
contrive most tools and instruments, most engines,
and judge of fortifications, architecture, ships, wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and water-works, and whatever might make this
lower frame of things useful and serviceable to mankinde;
which severer studies he relieved with noble
and free Poetry-aid, once the pleasure and advancement
of the soul, made by those higher motions of
the minde more active and more large. To which I
adde her sister Musick, wherewith he revived his
tired spirits, lengthened (as he said) his sickly days,
opened his oppressed breast, eased his melancholy
thoughts, graced his happy pronunciation, ordered
and refined his irregular and gross inclinations, fixed
and quickened his floating and dead notions; and
by a secret, sweet and heavenly Vertue, raised his
spirit, as he confessed, sometime to a little less than
angelical exaltation. Curious he was to please his
ear, and as exact to please his eye; there being no
statues, inscriptions or coyns that the Vertuosi of Italy
could shew, the antiquaries of France could boast
off, or the great hoarder of rarieties the great duke of
Tuscany (whose antic coyns are worth ¬£100,000)
could pretend to, that he had not the view of. No
man could draw any place or work better, none
fancy and paint a portraicture more lively; being a
Durer for proportion, a Goltzius for a bold touch,
variety of posture, a curious and true shadow, an
Angelo for his happy fancy, and an Holben for
works.</p>

<p>'Neither was it a bare ornament of discourse, or
naked diversion of leisure time; but a most weighty
piece of knowledge that he could blazon most noble
and ancient coats, and thereby discern the relation,
interest, and correspondence of great families, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
thereby the meaning and bottom of all transactions,
and the most successful way of dealing with any
one family. His exercises were such as his employments
were like to be, gentle and man-like. Whereof
the two most eminent were riding and shooting
that at once wholesomely stirred, and nobly knitted
and strengthened his body. Two eyes he said he
travelled with; the one of wariness upon himself,
the other of observation upon others. This compleat
gentleman was guardian to the young Brandon
in his younger years, agent for Sir John Mason in
king Edward the sixth's time, and the first embassador
for the state in Queen Elizabeth's time. My
Lord Cobham is to amuse the Spaniard, my Lord
Effingham to undermine the French, and Sir Henry
Killigrew is privately sent to engage the German
princes against Austria in point of interest, and for
her majesty in point of religion: he had a humour
that bewitched the elector of Bavaria, a carriage that
awed him of Mentz, a reputation that obliged them
of Colen and Hydelberg, and that reach and fluency
in discourse that won them all. He assisted the
Lords Hunsdon and Howard at the treaty with
France in London, and my Lord of Essex in the
war for France and Britain. Neither was he less
observable for his own conduct than for that of
others, whose severe thoughts, words and carriage
so awed his inferiour faculties, as to restrain him
through all the heats of youth, made more than
usually importunate by the full vigour of a high and
sanguine constitution; insomuch that they say he
looked upon all the approaches to that sin, then so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
familiar to his calling as a souldier, his quality as a
gentleman, and his station as a courtier, not onely
with an utter disallowance in his judgement, but
with a natural abhorrency and antipathy in his very
lower inclinations. To which happiness it conduced
not a little, that though he had a good, yet he had a
restrained appetite (a knife upon his throat as well
as upon his trencher) that indulged itself neither
frequent nor delicate entertainment; its meals,
though but once a day, being its pressures, and its
fast, its only sensualities; to which temperance in
diet, adde but that in sleep, together with his disposal
of himself throughout his life to industry and
diligence, you will say he was a spotless man, whose
life taught us this lesson, (which, if observed, would
accomplish mankinde; and which King Charles the
first would inculcate to noble travellers, and Dr.
Hammond to all men), viz.: <em>To be furnished always
with something to do</em>; a lesson they proposed as the
best expedience for innocence and pleasure; the
foresaid blessed man assuring his happy hearers,
"<em>That no burden is more heavy, or temptation more
dangerous, then to have time lie on one's hand: the idle
man being not onely</em>" (as he worded it) "<em>the Devil's
shop, but his kingdome too; a model of, and an appendage
unto Hell, a place given up to torment and to mischief</em>."'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>He left four daughters only, Anna, Dorothy,
Elizabeth, and Mary, by his wife Katherine, fourth
of the erudite daughters of Sir Anthony Cooke, of
Giddy Hall, Essex, the accomplished Preceptor of
Edward VI.&mdash;'vir antiqua serenitate,' according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Camden&mdash;from whom (as Strype tells us) his
'daughter Killigrew' inherited, amongst other things,
'a nest of white bowls.'</p>

<p>Dame Katherine was skilled, after the manner of
the learned ladies of her time, in Hebrew, Greek, and
Latin, and in poetry; and both Sir John Harrington
and Thomas Fuller commend and quote her compositions.
But that, with all her learning, she had,
what was even better, a devotedly affectionate heart,
let the following lines testify, which she addressed to
her sister Mildred, who had married Cecil, Lord
Burghley.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The Lord Treasurer was about to send
his young relative on a diplomatic mission to France,
at a dangerous juncture&mdash;whether before or after the
death in that country of Thomas Hobby, who
married her sister Elizabeth, and who also went to
France as an ambassador, I am uncertain&mdash;while the
loving Katherine thought her husband would be safer
and happier with her in Cornwall&mdash;probably either at
Arwenack, or at Rosmeryn in Budock, or at Trevose
in Mawgan, or at Penwerris, at all of which places
were estates of the Killigrews. The dauntless wife
thus threatens Elizabeth's solemn First Minister:</p>

<div lang="la" xml:lang="la" class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Si mihi quem cupio cures Mildreda remitti<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tu bona, tu melior, tu mihi sola soror:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sin male cessando retines, et trans mare mittis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tu mala, tu pejor, tu mihi nulla soror.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is si Cornubiam, tibi pax sit et omnia l√¶ta,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sin Mare, Cicili√¶ nuncio bella. Vale.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Of which, for the benefit of (some few at least of) my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
lady readers in these later days, I have appended
Fuller's harsh translation:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'If, Mildred, by thy care, he be sent back whom I request,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sister <em>good</em> thou art to me, yea <em>better</em>, yea the <em>best</em>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if with stays thou keep'st him still, or send'st where seas may part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then unto me a sister <em>ill</em>, yea <em>worse</em>, yea <em>none</em> thou art.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If go to Cornwall he shall <em>please</em>, I <em>peace</em> to thee foretell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, Cecil, if he set to Seas, I <em>war</em> denounce. Farewell.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Fortunately, thanks to the poetic skill of my friend
Mr. H. G. Hewlett, I am able to give his smoother
and more classical rendering of the lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Mildred! if truly my sister, the best, the one of all others,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Make it thy care to send back him whom I love to my arms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If by neglect thou withholdest thine aid, and art cause of his exile,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wicked, the worst, wilt thou be, sister in nowise of mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should he to Cornwall return, all is peace with the Cecils and kindness;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If o'er the sea he depart, count on my hatred! Farewell!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I do not know the exact date of Dame Katherine
Killigrew's death; but she was alive on the 22nd May,
1576. She was buried in the Church of St. Thomas
the Apostle, in the Vintry Ward of the City of
London, where there is&mdash;or rather was, for the
church is destroyed&mdash;'her elegant monument;' and
many Greek and Latin verses were addressed to
her memory by her sister Elizabeth and others. She
thus wrote her own epitaph:</p>

<div lang="la" xml:lang="la" class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Dormio nunc Domino, Domini virtute resurgam;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mortua ne dicar, fruitur pars altera Christo:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Et surgam capiti tempore tota meo.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>By his second wife, Jael de Peigne, the friend
and hostess of Isaac Casaubon, our Sir Henry left
two sons, Sir Joseph and Sir Henry Killigrew, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
one daughter; but nearly all traces of Sir Joseph and
his sister Jane are lost, save what is interesting to
the genealogist alone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But Henry was a man of some mark. He was
one of those loyal Members of the House of
Commons who refused to join the Parliament
against the Crown, and is described by Clarendon
as 'a person of entire affections to the King,' and
as commanding a troop of horse on Charles I.'s
march from Shrewsbury to London in 1642.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The
Lords Capel and Hopton were particular friends of
his; and with such Royalist connexions and predilections,
one is not surprised to learn that, together
with Messrs. Coryton, Scawen, and Roscarroth, he
was elected one of the Royal Commissioners for the
County of Cornwall; and that, when Pendennis
Castle was besieged, he was one of its stout defenders,
remaining in it to the very last, and striving,
both by sword and pen, to shake off the grip of the
Roundhead bulldogs; all in vain, as we have already
seen. The following letter from Lord Jermyn, who
had married his cousin Katherine, serves to show, at
once how sore were the straits of the besieged, and
how highly their efforts were rated by Queen Henrietta
Maria. (It will be remembered that Harry
Jermyn was commander-in-chief of the army which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
marched from York to Oxford for the relief of
Charles I., under the Queen, who used to style herself,
'She Majesty Generalissima over all.' It is
believed that relations of too intimate a character
existed between the Queen and <em>her</em> commander-in-chief.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'<span class="smcap">My dear Cousin Harry</span>,</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I have received yours, and truly do, with all
the grief and respect that you can imagine to be in
any body, look upon your sufferings and bravery in
them; and do further assure you that the relief of
so many excellent men, and preservation of so important
a place, is taken into all the considerations
that the utmost possibility, that can be in the Queen
to contribute to either, can extend to. The same
care is in the prince, from whose own hand you will
particularly understand it.</p>

<p>'I have now only time to tell you, that I am confident
those little stores that will give us and you
time to stay and provide for more, will be arrived
with you; and I do not so encourage you vainly,
but to let you know a truth that cannot fail, that if
you, as I do no way doubt, have rightly represented
the state of the place, and of the minds that are in
it, you shall be enabled to give the account of it you
wish beyond your expectations; and already some
money is at the sea-side for this purpose, and more
shall daily be sent. I entreat most earnestly of you
that the Governor, Sir John Digby, and those other
gentlemen that did me the honour to write to me,
may find here that I shall not fail to give them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
answer by the next. In the mean space, God of
heaven keep you all, and give us, if he please, a

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>On the surrender of the Castle,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Sir Henry appears
to have gone to St. Malo, where he died on 27th
September, 1646, from splinter-wounds received in
the forehead by the explosion of a firearm whilst
he was discharging it in the air after the capitulation
of Pendennis. Clarendon sums up his character for
us as being 'a very gallant gentleman, of a noble extraction,
and a fair revenue in land; he was of
excellent parts and great courage, and was exceedingly
beloved. He was a passionate opposer of the
extravagant proceedings of the Parliament;' and,
when it came to blows, though he 'was in all actions,
and in those parts where there was most danger,
yet he would take no command in the army, yet he
was always consulted; he was of great courage, and
of a pleasant humour, but was a sharp reprover of
those who neglected their duty. His loss was much
lamented by all good men.' The Rev. Lionel
Gatford (who acted as chaplain to the Royalists
during the siege of Pendennis) preached Sir Henry
Killigrew's funeral sermon, which is described in a
MS. in the possession of S. Elliott Hoskins, M.D.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
F.R.S., Guernsey, as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">'une perle de grand prix,
lequel ravissoit le c&oelig;ur de ses auditeurs.'</span></p>

<p>Whilst he lay dying of his wound at St. Malo, some
priests tried to convert him to the Roman faith; but
he would have nothing to say to them, and sent
for a clergyman of his own Communion forthwith.
By his own wish his body was taken across to
Jersey. It lay in state at the Constable's house at
St. Helier's, guarded by his exiled soldiers. The
funeral was performed with all military honours, on
3rd October, 1646, and the corpse was laid in a vault
in the church or 'Temple' of St. Helier's, near that
of Maximilian Norys. His income had been about
¬£800 a year before the troubles of the Civil War;
but he had lost it all.</p>

<p>Sir Henry married a lady named Jemima Bael,
and by her had one son, Henry. He too was a
warrior; and fell, a Major in the King's army, at
Bridgewater in 1644, whilst defending a magazine of
provisions against an attack by the Parliamentary
troops: 'a very hopeful young man,' says Clarendon,
'the son of a gallant and most deserving father.'</p>

<p>As we have already seen, three daughters only
were the fruit of old Sir Henry's first marriage with
Katherine Cooke.</p>

<p>Sir William Killigrew, Knight, the first Sir
Henry's next brother, now claims a short notice.
He too&mdash;Killigrew-like&mdash;was about the Court, for he
was a Groom of the Privy Chamber to James I.,
and was sworn in Chamberlain of the Exchequer on
28th November, 1605. He married Margaret
Saundars of Uxbridge, a widow lady; and they seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
to have been a steady-going old couple, to whom, it
may be mentioned, John Fox and Robert Some
dedicated a volume of their sermons. There is some
correspondence about Sir William in the Lansdowne
MSS. touching his 'farming' the Seals of the
Queen's Bench and Common Pleas, to which the
Chief Justice of the latter court objected; and Sir
William, who was appointed to his post by Burghley,
seems to have ultimately compromised matters by
receiving the sum of ¬£3,000. The Additional MSS.
contain other references to him; but hardly anything
of sufficient interest to warrant our lingering over
his share in the family history. He died at Lothbury
on 23rd November, 1622; and his portrait, with that
of Thomas Carew, by Van Dyck, is preserved in the
collection of Her Majesty Queen Victoria. Richard
Carew says that he was 'the most kind patron of all
his country and countrymen's (county) affairs at
Court.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But from this Sir William and 'Mystresse
Margarye' descended Killigrews who have made
some noise in the world, as we shall presently
find. Besides two daughters, Katherine and Elizabeth&mdash;both
of whom married, but make no figure in
our story&mdash;they had a son, Sir Robert Killigrew of
Hanworth, a wealthy man, and Chamberlain to two
Queens of England, viz., Elizabeth and the hapless
consort of Charles I. He too kept up the old family
connexion with Pendennis Castle&mdash;of which he was
made Governor in succession to Sir John Parker, on
11th June, 1632, towards the close of his life; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
he further served the Crown by going, in 1625, as an
Ambassador to the United Provinces. Sir Robert
was an original shareholder in the New River Company
(incorporated in 1619); and was a great stickler
for his rights in the matter of the reclaimed lands
in Lindsey Level, Lincolnshire (as to which, see
Dugdale's 'History of Embanking'); moreover,
Farnaby, the celebrated schoolmaster, dedicated to
him the 1624 edition of his translations of 'Martial's
Epigrams.' He was once 'sequestered' for a manual
scuffle in the House, in 1614, as appears in Spedding's
'Works of Francis Bacon;' and he was mixed up in
the story about the poisoned powder administered to
Sir Thomas Overbury, though it was clearly proved
that Killigrew was not to blame in that matter; but it
is nevertheless true that he was sent from the Council
Table to the Fleet Prison for talking with Overbury
at his prison-window, after having paid a visit to Sir
Walter Raleigh in the Tower of London.</p>

<p>Sir Robert gave Whitelocke 'a place for Helston,'
whereupon Whitelocke caused his brother-in-law
Bulstrode to be returned for that place. He
must have had a fine seat at Hanworth; for Conway,
writing to Buckingham on 3rd May, 1623, says that
on that day the King passed Sir Robert Killigrew's,
'and there saw the designment of a fine ground: a
pretty lodge, a gracious lady, a fair maid, the
daughter, and a fine bouquet. He saw the pools,
the deer, and the herondry; which was his errand.'</p>

<p>When he took to himself a wife, he went to a
good stock, for he selected Mary Wodehouse, a
daughter of Sir Henry Wodehouse, of Kimberley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Norfolk,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> known as the 'young' or the 'French'
Lady Killigrew. She was a niece of one whose name
(erroneously as we apply it) is familiar to every
Englishman&mdash;I mean Lord Bacon. Of Sir Robert
himself, little more need be said here than that he
died on the 26th November, 1632; but his offspring
will detain us much longer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sir Robert had six daughters and five sons; and
it may be as well to offer first the slight result of
my inquiries into the careers of the former.</p>

<p>They were about the Court of Charles II.; and
one of them, Elizabeth, who married Viscount
Shannon, became one of the dissolute King's mistresses.
She died at her house in Pall Mall on 28th
July, 1684, and was buried in Westminster Abbey,
'having no Coat-of-arms of her own, as the King
had assigned her none.' Mary married Sir John
James, Knight; and has a monument at the east end
of the north choir aisle in Westminster Abbey. Of
the others, I can only learn that they married men of
title&mdash;one the Earl of Yarmouth; another Berkeley,
Lord Fitz-Hardinge; and one married into a grand
old Cornish family&mdash;the Godolphins. Another,
Anne, 'a beauty and a poetess,' was the first wife of
George Kirk, and the unhappy lady was drowned at
London Bridge, in the Queen's barge, in July, 1641;
like so many others of her race, she was interred
in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>Robert, the eldest son, died young. The only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
trace I can find of him is the following college exercise
on the birth of Charles II.:</p>

<span class="i2">Non deerit, vel te deficiente, dies.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>His brother William, next in age, succeeded him as
the representative of the family&mdash;a position which
he must have held for about seventy years; for he
was nearly ninety when he died, in or about 1694.
When a Gentleman Commoner of Oxford he wrote
some verses, which Henry Lawes thought good enough
to set to music; he also wrote four plays; and when
he left the University (where he afterwards took
the degree of D.C.L.), he was forthwith welcomed
at Court, and became a Gentleman Usher of the
Privy Chamber, and afterwards Vice-Chamberlain
to Queen Katherine. About 1661 he was made a
Baronet, probably on account of his loyal attachment
to the late King, whose body-guard he often
commanded. At York, when the Civil War broke
out in 1642, he commanded a troop of cavalry, composed
of servants and retainers of the 1st troop of
Life Guards, under Lord Bernard Stuart; and at
Edgehill he was one of the foremost in Prince
Rupert's fiery charge&mdash;a charge which at once began
and had almost ended the battle.</p>

<p>Old Sir William kept up the Killigrew connexion
with the West-country, by being, in his turn also,
made Governor of Pendennis; but he is best known
and remembered by two little books which he wrote
very late in life, and especially by his 'Artless Midnight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Thoughts,' written when he was eighty-two
years old, and described by himself as the reflexions
'of a gentleman at Court, who for many years built
on sand, which every Blast of Cross Fortune has
defaced; but now he has laid new Foundations on
the Rock of his Salvation, which no Storms can
shake; and will outlast the Conflagration of the
World, when Time shall melt into Eternity.'<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>This curious little work is full of pious reflexions
and thoughts, both in prose and verse. It was dedicated
first to Charles II., and afterwards to James II.,
who had made his old age much happier than ever
his youth was, 'when I shared in all the glories of this
Court, and splendour of Four great Kings for three
score years.' He himself describes the book as 'a
small parcel of such fruit as my little cell in White
Hall doth naturally produce from the barren brains
of 82 years old.' He also wrote some plays of
a very different stamp from those of his younger
brother, as may be judged from the following
lines:</p>

<p>He was buried at the Savoy some time between
1693 and 1695, and left by his wife, Mary Hill, a
Warwickshire lady, one son, Sir Robert, Vice-Chamberlain
to Queen Anne of Denmark, and some
time Lord of the Manor of Crediton, in Devon,
whose only son Sir Henry died in St. Giles'-in-the-Fields,
without issue. Of his two daughters, one,
Elizabeth, married Sir Francis Clifton; the other,
Mary, married Frederic de Nassau, Lord of Zulestein.
Their son William Henry was in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
favour with our William III., who, in 1695, created
him Baron Enfield, Viscount Tonbridge, and Earl
of Rochford; but, as we have seen, the descent, in
<em>the male line</em>, from old Sir William became extinct.</p>

<p>The venerable author of the 'Artless Thoughts'
had, however, two brothers&mdash;Thomas<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and Henry&mdash;and
of these we have now to speak. Of the former,
'Tom Killigrew, the King's jester,' as he is sometimes
inaccurately styled&mdash;probably more persons
have heard than of any other member of this family;
and for his fame he is indebted, perhaps, in as great a
degree to his being enshrined in the pages of that delightful
gossip, Samuel Pepys, as to his printed plays.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tom was Sir Robert's fourth son, and was born
in 1611. Very early he became, through the family
influence, a Page of Honour to Charles I.; and he
followed into exile that monarch's dissolute son, to
whom, on the Restoration, he became a Groom of
the Bedchamber and Master of the Revels, with a
salary of ¬£400 per annum. He seems to have added
to his income by taking fees from those who were
silly enough to offer them for using his interest in
procuring for the gullible candidates the post of
'King's physic-taster,' or His Majesty's 'curtain-drawer.'
Doubtless Killigrew was sometimes a minister
to the profligacies of the 'merry' monarch; yet he
was also one who could venture to tell a home-truth
to the King when it was absolutely necessary, and
when no one else durst do it. The following story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
may serve as an example. One day, Tom Killigrew
came into the King's presence, clothed in pilgrim's
weeds, and with a staff in his hand, evidently prepared
for some long journey. 'Whatever are you
about now, Killigrew?' cried the King; 'where are
you going?' 'To hell, sir!' replied Tom, 'to fetch
back one Oliver Cromwell to this unfortunate
country; it was governed badly enough in his time,
but infinitely better then than it is now.' An engraved
portrait of him, dressed as a pilgrim, and
another after Wissing, representing him with a beard,
and armed with a sword, are preserved in the Print
Room of the British Museum. Another instance of
his adroitness in recalling Charles to a sense of his
duty may be mentioned. The King found councils
tedious; and would often leave them before the
business was concluded,</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or with the tangles of Ne√¶ra's hair,<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">greatly to the disgust of (amongst others) Lauderdale.
Accordingly, on a certain day, Tom Killigrew&mdash;between
whom and the Chancellor no love
seems to have been lost&mdash;offered to bet ¬£100
that <em>he</em> could bring the King to the council, though
the minister himself could not. The bet was concluded,
and Killigrew started off after His Majesty, knowing
probably better than anyone else where he was
likely to be found. At once he disclosed to Charles
what had happened, and urged the King to let him
win the bet, whereby he, Tom Killigrew, would be
¬£100 (sorely wanted, perhaps) in pocket; whilst
Lauderdale, who was remarkable for the tight grip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
with which he held his money, would be mulct in
that amount. Charles could not resist the double
pleasure of annoying Lauderdale and gratifying
Killigrew, and so granted the latter's request, and
won his bet for him.</p>

<p>Thomas Killigrew was sent&mdash;not without some
misgivings, as it would seem&mdash;by Charles II., whilst
in exile, as 'Resident' to Venice; and his instructions
from the King (with many other papers, some of
which are in Killigrew's own writing, are preserved
among the Harleian MSS., in the British Museum)
throw an amusing light upon the circumstances of
the Ambassador and his Royal Master. They were,
amongst other things, 'to presse the Duke to furnish
Us with a present Some of Money and We will
engage Ourself by any Act or Acts to repay with
Interest, and so like wise for any Armes and Ammunition
hee shalbe pleased to furnish Us withall.
The summe you shall moue him to furnish Us with
shall be Ten thousand Pistolls.'</p>

<p>Killigrew's first paper was presented to the
Duke and Senate in Venice, 14th February,
1649-50. It consists of five closely-written folio
pages in Latin, and he quotes in it King James's
saying of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">'Sublato Episcopo tollitur Rex,'</span> in support
of his arguments against the cause of 'the
Rebels,' who, Charles feared, might be sending an
ambassador of their own, on a similar errand, to
that Court.</p>

<p>This mission does not seem to have proved very
successful; and Tom Killigrew and his servants got
into sad disgrace at Venice with the Doge, Francis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Erizzo, and other authorities, for their riotous
behaviour, the result being that the whole party
were dismissed; deservedly perhaps, but somewhat
informally. On Thomas Killigrew's return to the
English Court, Sir John Denham addressed him in
these lines:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">'Our Resident Tom<br /></span>
<span class="i8">From Venice is come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And has left all the statesmen behind him;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Talks at the same pitch,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Is as wise, and as rich,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And just where you left him you'll find him.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">'But who says he's not<br /></span>
<span class="i8">A man of much plot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May repent of this false accusation;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Having plotted and penned<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Six plays, to attend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the farce of his negotiation.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The last three lines naturally lead us to a consideration
of the 'Resident's' dramatic works,
written, as he says, to beguile the tedium of exile.
Thomas Killigrew wrote eleven plays in all; and,
according to Genest, strictly speaking wrote but two
at Venice; but the four written at Naples, Rome,
Turin and Florence, were probably completed before
his return to Paris. Dibdin, in his 'History of the
Stage,' points out that these plays are by no means
original, tracing some of them to their sources, and
calling them 'paste-and-scissors' affairs. But this
is not their chief defect. I have, as I thought myself
in duty bound, read one of them, and intend never
to read another. How it was possible, even
in that dissolute age&mdash;'never to be recalled,' as
Macaulay says, 'without a blush'&mdash;for a man to sit
down and deliberately write such obscene buffoonery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and dedicate it to ladies&mdash;some of whom were his
own relations&mdash;I cannot imagine. Plays too, of which
one, at least, 'The Parson's Wedding,' was to be performed
wholly by women! and in which the words
assigned to those who played the women's parts
are scarcely less offensive than those supposed to be
spoken by men!<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> We find ourselves indeed 'surrounded
by foreheads of bronze, hearts like the
nether millstone, and tongues set on fire of hell.' I
must add that they have scarcely a sparkle of that
witty wickedness which one meets with in the
writings of Sir Charles Sedley;&mdash;luckily they are
dead, and they deserved to die! It is difficult to
find an extract which is now presentable; and I
can put my hand on no better specimen, on the
whole, than this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p class="center small"><span class="smcap">Walking.</span></p>

<p class="small">'<em>Fine Lady.</em> I am glad I am come home, for I am weary of this
walking; for God's sake whereabouts does the pleasure of walking lie?
I swear I have often sought it till I was weary; and yet I could ne'er
find it.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Not all of the plays were performed; though 'The
Parson's Wedding' certainly was, at the King's
House, and Luellin told Pepys that it was 'an
obscene, loose play.' 'Claracilla,' a 'tragi-comedy,'
Pepys himself went to see on 4th July, 1661; he
merely says, however, that when he first saw it, it
was 'well acted.' On a second occasion, when he
saw it performed at the Cockpit, he thought it 'a
poor play.' He might, in my opinion, have said the
same of them all; but they were nevertheless sumptuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
printed. King Charles II.'s own copy is in
the British Museum (644, m. 11), and a portrait of
the author contemplating the huge pile of his
precious productions is prefixed to the volume.
The original of this portrait was painted by W.
Sheppard, and splendidly engraved by William
Faithorne; another portrait (also by Sheppard,
according to Redgrave) is in the possession of
Mr. J. Buller East, to whom it was presented,
shortly before her death in 1819, by Frances Maria
Killigrew, the last of her name. There is yet
another portrait of Thomas Killigrew, which represents
him, not, as Walpole says in his 'Anecdotes
of Painting,' 'in a studious posture,' but
stooping, worn out with his vicious life, with a
gibbering monkey at his side, and clad in a tawdry
dressing-gown, on which are represented the portraits
of a host of the wantons of his acquaintance.
The lines at the foot of this rare engraving by
Bosse (British Museum, {669. f. 4}/90) are an even more
savage caricature than the picture itself.</p>

<p>Of Tom Killigrew's early fondness for plays, Pepys'
story will serve as an illustration. 'I would not
forget,' he writes, 'two passages of Sir J. Minne's
at yesterday's dinner, one being Thomas Killigrew's
way of getting to see plays when he was a boy. He
would go to the Red Bull, and when the man cried
to the boys, "Who will go and be a devil, and he
shall see the play for nothing?" then would he go
in, and be a devil upon the stage, and so get to see
plays.' Would it be going too far to say that
throughout his connection with the stage he stuck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
to his youthful part? He talked, however, much
better than he wrote; with Cowley the case was the
reverse; hence Denham's epigram:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Had Cowley ne'er spoke, Killigrew ne'er writ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Combined in one they'd make a matchless wit.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Pepys describes him as 'a merry droll, but a
gentleman of great esteem with the King; he told us
many merry stories;' again, that Killigrew was 'a
great favourite with the King on account of his uncommon
vein of humour;' though on one occasion,
when the King went to the Tower of London, to see
the Dunkirk money, the conversation of Killigrew
and the others was but 'poor and frothy.' More than
once, however, Tom Killigrew, to his credit, spoke
out, and to the point, in a tone of which we have
already heard something; and Pepys himself has
thus chronicled it:</p>

<p>'Mr. Pierce did also tell me as a great truth, as being
told it by Mr. Cowley (Abraham Cowley the poet),
and who was by and heard it, that <em>Tom Killigrew</em>
should publickly tel the King that his matters were
coming into a very ill state; but that yet there was
a way to help all. Says he, "There is a good, honest,
able man that I could name, that if your Majesty
would employ, and command to see all things well
executed, all things would soon be mended; and this
is one Charles Stuart, who now spends his time in
employing his lips about the Court, and hath no
other employment; but if you would give him this
employment, he were the fittest man in the world
to perform it."'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>On another occasion, when even Charles reproached
the 'chartered libertine' with his many
'idle words,' Killigrew did not shrink from retorting,
with special significance, on the King, that,
after all, '<em>idle promises</em> and <em>idle patents</em>' were even
worse.</p>

<p>But something should be said of the domestic
affairs of the subject of these observations. He
lived, I believe, near that part of the old Court of
Whitehall where Scotland Yard now stands; and,
whilst there, married his first wife, Cecilia, daughter
of Sir James Croft&mdash;a maid of honour to Henrietta
Maria, and a lady whose portrait by Vandyck is in
her present Majesty's collection.</p>

<p>The weather was rude and boisterous on the
wedding-day, which gave rise to the following lines
by Thomas Carew:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Such should this day be; so the sun should hide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bashfull face, and let the conquering bride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a rivall shine, whilst he forbeares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mingle his unequall beames with hers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or if sometime he glance his squinting eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betweene the parting clouds, 'tis but to spye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not emulate her glories; so comes drest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vayles, but as a masquer to the feast.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>I fear their wedded life must have been stormy
throughout; the very first thing we hear of their courtship
is a dispute in which they became engaged; and
by-and-by we hear of Madam Killigrew's 'Case,'
which sets forth that she brought her husband a fortune
of ¬£10,000, which Tom, writing from the Hague<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
in 1654<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> (the year in which his wife died of small-pox),
solemnly promised not to waste or otherwise
dispose of. Two houses in Scotland Yard were built
with the money, or part of it. Francis Quarles thus
bemoaned the hapless lady's fate: 'Sighes at the
contemporary deaths of those incomparable Sisters&mdash;the
Countesse of Cleaveland and Mistrisse Cicily
Killegreue.' (They appear to have been buried in
the same tomb, and to have died within twice two
days of each other.) The little poem ends
thus:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">'My pen,<br /></span>
<span class="i15">Thou hast transgrest;<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Archangels, and not Men<br /></span>

<span class="i6">But we have done, we leave them to the trust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heaven's eternall Towre, and kisse their sacred Dust.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>About this time we come across a characteristic
little story about Tom Killigrew in Evelyn's
'Diary.'</p>

<p>Sir Richard Browne, writing from Nantes, 1st
November, 1653, to Hyde, then Chancellor of the
Exchequer, says that he has sent to him, carriage
paid, three barrels of canary wine to Mr. Thomas
Killigrew's care. But Hyde does not seem to have
got them, at any rate for a very long time. He heard
of the arrival of the consignment at Paris, and that
it was there 'conceaved to be Mr. Killigrew's own
wyne'!&mdash;very possibly, it may be feared, from the use
to which the consignee was putting it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Thomas Killigrew was associated with Dryden,
Sir William Davenant, and others, in obtaining a
license (which, by the way, Sir Henry Herbert, his
predecessor in the office of Master of the Revels,
vainly endeavoured to get revoked) for a company of
players, and a playhouse which was called the
Theatre Royal, and which was situated somewhere
between Drury Lane and Bridge Street.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>In fact, Killigrew was playhouse mad, as may
be further seen by this extract from Pepys, date
1664:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />

<p>'To King's playhouse: saw Bartholomew Fayre. I
chanced to sit by Tom Killigrew, who tells me that
he is setting up a nursery: that is, is going to build
a house in Moorefields, wherein he will have common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
plays acted. But four operas it shall have in the
year, to act six weeks at a time, where we shall have
the best scenes and machines&mdash;the best musique,
and everything as magnificent as is in Christendome,
and to that end hath sent for voices and painters,
and other persons from Italy.'</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'It might naturally have been supposed' (observes
Genest in his 'History of the Stage') 'that Killigrew,
on becoming patentee of the Theatre Royal, would
have brought out some of his own plays; it does not,
however, appear that any of them were ever acted,
except "The Parson's Wedding" and "Claricilla."
On the contrary, the silence of Langbaine and
Downes does not amount to a proof that none were
acted; as Langbaine did not frequent the theatres
till several years after the Restoration, and Downes's
account of the Theatre Royal is very imperfect. "The
Pilgrim" is a good T. (theatre) play, with judicious
alterations it might have been made fit for representation.
"Cicilia" and "Clarinda," "Thomaso" and
"Bellamira's Dream," are, each of them, rather one
play in ten acts, than two distinct plays. When a
play is written in two parts, there ought to be some
sort of a conclusion at the end of the fifth act, but
in these plays there is no more conclusion at the end
of the fifth act than at the end of the first; improprieties
occur in numberless plays, but perhaps no
author ever made such strange jumbles as Killigrew
has made in "The Princess," and "Cicilia" and
"Clarinda." All his plays are in prose&mdash;most of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
are of an enormous and tiresome length&mdash;verbosity is
his perpetual fault&mdash;there is scarcely a scene in
which the dialogue might not be shortened to advantage.'</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />
<p>But to return to Killigrew's domestic affairs. Tom
married a second time&mdash;one Charlotte Van Hess, who
is described as first Lady of the Queen's Privy
Chamber in 1662, and as also holding the apparently
delectable appointment of Keeper of Her Majesty's
Sweet Coffer. By this marriage there were three
sons&mdash;Thomas, Robert, and Charles, of whom more
hereafter.</p>

<p>Tom Killigrew must have been nearly sixty years
old when he narrowly escaped assassination in St.
James's Park. He had had an intrigue with Lady
Shrewsbury, but found a dangerous and more successful
rival in the Duke of Buckingham; whereupon
the disappointed rake turned upon the lady a
stream of foul and venomous satire. The result
was that one evening, on his return from the Duke
of York's, some ruffians, probably hirelings of the
inconstant fair one, set upon Tom's chair, through
which they made no less than three passes with
their swords, one of them wounding him in the arm.
The assassins fled, leaving Tom Killigrew in danger
of death, and his man quite dead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
This brings nearly to a close all that needs be
said about Thomas Killigrew, who died thirteen or
fourteen years after the foregoing event, on the
19th March, 1682/3, and was buried in Westminster
Abbey.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his vices, it may at least be recorded
to his credit that he was faithful to the Stuart
cause which he adopted; was never ambitious, or
avaricious; and that it was said of him when he
died, that 'he was bewailed by his friends, and truly
wept for by the poor.'</p>

<p>His will is dated on the 15th March, and was
proved in the Prerogative Court on the 19th of the
same month by his son Henry, his executor, and
residuary legatee. He left some houses in Scotland
Yard, and he mentions a pension from the King.
'In the will,' says my authority, '<em>there is no jest</em>.'
That his pecuniary affairs were not in a very
satisfactory condition would seem to be the case
from a statement of 'Secret Money Services Charles
II. and James II.,' 'Payd to several persons for the
respective causes, uses and purposes und<sup>r</sup>-menc'oned,
as by divers acquittances &amp; a particular accompt
signed &amp; allowed in the like manner on the 14th day
of June, 1683, doth appear, several sumes amounting
to ¬£4,743 4¬Ωd.&mdash;amongst others To James Gray, for
and towards the funeral charges of Tho<sup>s</sup>. Killigrew,
deceased, ¬£50.' This supposition would also appear
to be confirmed by the following autograph
letter, written when Tom Killigrew must have been
about seventy years old (Harl. MSS. 2, 7005, art.
42):&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Of his three sons by his second marriage, Thomas,
generally known as Tom Killigrew the younger, was
Gentleman of the Bedchamber to George II., when
Prince of Wales, and was somewhat of a playwright,
like his father. He wrote a piece called 'Chit-Chat'
(in which, by the way, the mercurial Colley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Cibber played the principal part&mdash;'Alamode, a fop').
It was produced at Drury Lane shortly before the
author's death, an event which took place at Kensington,
in July, 1719. This play is said to have been
very successful&mdash;was one of 'the four taking plays
of the season'&mdash;and on its production the Prince
made Killigrew a present of 100 guineas, to which
the Princess added another fifty. As far as I can
make out&mdash;though the matter is involved in great
obscurity&mdash;the lady to whom reference has already
been made as the possessor of the elder Tom Killigrew's
portrait, and as dying, the last of her name,
in 1819, must have descended from this branch of
the family.</p>

<p>Robert, brother of the foregoing Thomas the
younger, was a soldier. 'Militavit annos 24' is
recorded on his monument in the north aisle of the
nave of Westminster Abbey;<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and he had risen to the
rank of Major-General, when he fell on the plains of
Almanza, near Chinchilla, on 25th April, 1707, being
then forty-seven years old. This battle was fought,
during the Spanish war of succession, between the
Spanish and French, commanded by the Duke of
Berwick (a natural son of James II.), and the allied
English and Dutch forces under the incompetent
General Ruvigny, Earl of Galway; on which occasion
the latter were defeated; the fate of Spain was
decided; and the Bourbon line was practically restored
to the Spanish throne, in the person of Philip V.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Galway&mdash;</p>

<p class="pfs80">'Deep versed in books, but shallow in himself'</p>

<p class="noind">(a red-tapeist general, who fought always according
to rule),&mdash;'drew up his troops agreeably to
the manner prescribed by the best writers, and, in a
few hours, lost 18,000 men, 120 standards, all his
baggage, and all his artillery.' 'Do you remember,
child,' says the foolish woman in the <cite>Spectator</cite> to her
husband, 'that the pigeon-house fell the very afternoon
that our careless wench spilt the salt upon the
table?' 'Yes, my dear,' replies the gentleman,
'and the next post brought us an account of the
battle of Almanza.'<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>This battle is further remarkable as having been the
first occasion on which the Union Jack was used as the
British Ensign; and from its being almost the first
time when British troops used the bayonet; it is
also noteworthy, because at Almanza English and
Dutch troops, commanded by a Frenchman, were
defeated by French and Spaniards, commanded by a
British General. The battle was fought on a plain
about a mile in front of the town; and, I believe, an
obelisk still marks the site.</p>

<p>Colonel Townshend Wilson, in his 'Memoir of the
Duke of Berwick' (1883), gives a vivid description of
the stubbornly contested three hours' conflict&mdash;in
which 'never did Briton and Dutch face the foe more
steadily.' They were however out-numbered and
out-generalled&mdash;and on this day the old Das Minas
might have been seen, accompanied by a young lady,
his mistress, in a gay riding-habit, cantering to and
fro among the allied troops under fire; but an unmannerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
shot emptied her saddle. The end of the
battle is thus described:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'From stern resistance the cosmopolitan infantry
suddenly changed to brilliant attack. With a tremendous
effort they beat down all opponents. Two battalions,
irresistible in might, trampled down the enemy's
double line, pressed even to the walls of Almansa.
Superb audacity in front of well-led soldiers is sometimes
foolishness. Don Jos√© de Amezaga, with two
squadrons, charging the enemy, blown and in disarray,
cut them to pieces.... Then the wondrous
English and Huguenot foot, quite <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en l'air</i>, deprived
of support, most of their superior officers laid low,
thought of retreat. The man&oelig;uvre was impracticable.
Hundreds of men were trampled under the
hoofs of exulting cavaliers. Six battalions, crushed
into a crowd, had to lay down their arms. But
thirteen battalions (five of which were English),
holding grimly together, under Count Dhona, and
Major-General Shrimpton of the Guards, retired in
fine order to a hill about a league from the field.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Being, however, without provisions, these gallant
fellows were compelled on the following day to surrender
to their antagonists. The Spanish loss was
2,000; that of the Allies double that number, and
eighty-eight British officers, including Brigadier
Killigrew and Colonels Dormer and Roper, were
amongst the slain.</p>

<p>Among Brigadier Robert's small effects were
twenty-two pistoles, a bay horse, a pair of gold
buttons, and his watch and seal&mdash;as appears from
some family letters preserved among the 'Additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
MSS.' in the British Museum. He seems to have
found life a 'fitful fever,' for in his very last letter
to his brother&mdash;as 'T. K.' has endorsed it&mdash;he says
that he is 'verre wery of sarvin in this Hott Contre.'
But he was a courageous soldier; for his nephew,
Major Henry Killigrew, of the Irish Carabineers, who
seems to have also been present at the battle, writes
that 'no man there gave up his life with greater
bravery' than his uncle did. General Robert Killigrew,
in fact, appears to have deserved the place
which he attained amongst the Worthies of England
at Westminster.</p>

<p>Charles, the third brother, was born in 1650, and
was buried in the Savoy in 1725. He succeeded
his father in the post of Master of the Revels<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> in 1680,
with a fee of ¬£10 per annum; and he was made a
Commissioner of Prizes in 1707. J. T. Smith tells us
that he used to license, 'in black and red print,' all
ballad-singers, mountebanks, rope-dancers, prize-players,
'and such as make shew of motions and
strange sights.' He also succeeded to the ownership
of the play-house in Drury Lane; and is said to have
done much to correct the profaneness of the stage.</p>

<p>Amongst the Lord Chamberlain's Records of the
Reign of Charles II. is a volume marked 'Players<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Booke,' which contains many curious entries, such as
regulations against persons forcing their way into the
theatre without payment at the beginning of the last
acts of the piece. No actor to leave the theatre without
giving three months' warning. No visitor to
come between the scenes, or sit or stand upon the
stage during the time of acting. It also appears
that certain of the actors had entered into a bond of
¬£500 with Charles Killigrew for the theatrical properties,
and a regulation was made that thenceforth
none of the actors or actresses should 'presume to go
out of the House in theire acting Clothes.' The well
known Mohun, who was one of the parties to this
bond, had served as Major of a regiment in Flanders.</p>

<p>But Harry, who seems to have been a son of Tom
the elder, by his first wife Cecilia Crofts, took most
after his father. He was Groom of the Chamber to
James II., when Duke of York; and was the scapegrace
of the family. Pepys was more than once
shocked at his conduct, and speaks of him as a
'rogue newly come out of France.' Before he did
this he had earned a bad character abroad; for on
21st July, 1660, the Prince Palatine wrote of a duel
which Master Harry fought at Heidelberg, and adds,
'He will never leave his lying as long as his tongue
can wagg.' There were ugly suspicions of his having,
in a drunken fit, stabbed his own servant; and of
his having committed other outrageous misdeeds.
In 1666 he was banished from the Court, 'for raw
words spoken against a lady of pleasure.' Yet
he seems to have contrived to find his way back
again; for in 1667 occurred the memorable squabble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
between him and Buckingham, which Pepys thus
relates, and to which Charles II. also referred in a
letter to Prince Rupert:</p>

<p>'Creed tells me of the fray between the Duke of
Buckingham at the Duke's play-house the last
Saturday (and it is the first day I have heard that
they have acted at either the King's or Duke's
houses this month or six weeks), and Henry Killigrew,
whom the Duke of Buckingham did soundly
beat and take away his sword, and make a fool of,
till the fellow prayed him to spare his life; &amp; I am
glad of it, for it seems in this business the Duke of
Buckingham did carry himself very innocently &amp;
well, &amp; I wish he had paid this fellow's coat well.'</p>

<p>The quarrel seems to have originated in some insulting
words used by Harry Killigrew towards the
Duke from an adjoining box, and to these the Duke
replied in like fashion; whereupon a quarrel ensued,
which ended in a challenge from Killigrew. This
the Duke refused to accept, and a personal encounter
was the consequence&mdash;the two combatants chasing
each other round the house, to the great annoyance
of the rest of the audience, as may be supposed.
Killigrew seems to have lost his character as a man
of courage&mdash;whilst the Duke lost&mdash;his wig! as well
as his temper. I have not been able to discover
what became afterwards of this 'ne'er-do-weel,'
except that in 1698 he contrived to get a free grant
of ¬£200 from the Treasury. He married Lady
Mary Savage, had two sons (Henry and James),
and was buried on 16th December, 1705, at St.
Martin's-in-the-Fields.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>We have thus completed, so far as seemed
desirable, our sketches of all the sons and grandsons
of Sir Robert Killigrew of Hanworth, except that of
his fifth son, Henry; to him and to his career and
progeny we now turn. He was born at Hanworth
the year after his brother Tom, viz. in 1612; and
was at first educated, as Wood tells us, by that
celebrated schoolmaster, Farnaby, at St. Giles's,
Cripplegate. Thence he went to Christ Church,
Oxford, when sixteen years of age, and at that
University obtained his degrees of M.A. in 1638, and
D.D. four years afterwards. Of his Latinity when
at college, the following example, amongst others,
has been preserved:&mdash;</p>

<p>He, too, received a Court appointment, and was
Preceptor to James II. and a Chaplain to the King's
Army and to the Duke of York. In 1660, he was
made Prebendary of the Twelfth Stall at Westminster,
and about the same time Rector of Wheathampsted,
where are some of the family tombs. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
it was not until 1667, when he was between fifty
and sixty years of age, that he obtained the post in
connexion with which his name is most generally
known-that of 'Master of the Savoy and Almoner
to His Royal Highness.'</p>

<p>Whilst still a youngster of seventeen, he wrote a
tragedy which he called 'The Conspiracy,' intended
for performance at the celebration of the 'Nuptialls
of the Lord Charles Herbert and the Lady Villers.'
It was played at the Blackfriars Theatre in 1638, and
was received with great applause&mdash;obtaining high
praise from 'rare Ben Jonson' himself. One critic,
indeed, objected that the sentiments expressed by the
hero of the piece, Cleander, were far beyond his age&mdash;seventeen&mdash;until
he was reminded that that was
the age of the author himself. Here is a specimen

<p>The play appears to have been printed without
the writer's consent, in 1638, in an imperfect form;
but it was not until fifteen years afterwards that he
published an amended copy of it under the title of
'Pallantus and Eudora.' He also wrote another
play, 'The Tyrant King of Crete,' which was never
acted. Many of his sermons too were printed; one of
them, Pepys&mdash;who seems to have gone almost everywhere,
and heard almost everything&mdash;listened to in
1663: 'At Chapel I had room in the Privy Seale
pewe with other gentlemen;' but he has left no
record of the impression produced. Probably, therefore,
it was not very deep or lasting; and, in fact,
the sermons have no special excellence: yet there
is something true and pathetic in this saying:
'Misery lays stronger bonds of love than Nature;
and they are more than one, whom the same <em>misfortune</em>
joined together, than to whom the same womb
gave life.'</p>

<p>The Rev. W. J. Loftie, in his 'History of the
Savoy,' tells us that Henry Killigrew succeeded
Sheldon as Master, and that he was no more careful
and economic in the management of the decaying
establishment than was his predecessor; yet King
William III.'s Commissioners tell a somewhat
different story, and describe him as 'a man of generous
and public spirit, as his expenses in the Chapel
of the said Hospital, and of King Henry VII. at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Westminster, who was the founder of the said
Hospital, do sufficiently testify.'</p>

<p>In the Savoy itself Henry Killigrew lived, paying
¬£1 a year for his lodgings. No pleasant neighbourhood
was that 'Sanctuary'<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> which Macaulay thus
describes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'The Savoy was another place of the same
kind as Whitefriars; smaller indeed, and less renowned,
but inhabited by a not less lawless population.
An unfortunate tailor, who ventured to go
thither for the purpose of demanding payment for
a debt, was set upon by the whole mob of cheats,
ruffians, and courtezans. He offered to give a full
discharge to his debtor, and a treat to the rabble,
but in vain. He had violated their "franchises,"
and this crime was not to be pardoned. He was
knocked down, stripped, tarred, and feathered. A
rope was tied round his waist. He was dragged
naked up and down the street amidst yells of "A
bailiff! a bailiff!" Finally he was compelled to kneel
down, and curse his father and mother&mdash;and then
"to limp home without a rag upon him."'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The Master of the Savoy married twice, it is said;
but I have failed to trace the maiden name of
either of his wives. It would have been interesting
to know who the first was, especially; for she was
the mother of the fairest and brightest of all the
Killigrews&mdash;Mistress Anne. The second wife continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
to live in the Savoy after her husband's
death, which took place the 14th March, 1699.</p>

<p>He had two sons and two daughters. The sons,
both of whom were sailors, were Henry and James;
and the daughters, Elizabeth and the incomparable
ANNE. Clutterbuck, in his 'History of Hertfordshire,'
says that Elizabeth married Dr. J. Lambe,
Dean of Ely, who succeeded to the Rectory of
Wheathampstead; and that they had five sons and
five daughters. Her epitaph records that she was
'a most intirely beloved wife,' and that 'to mencÃÑon
some of her virtues only (though very great ones)
would lessen her character, who was a most
eminent example of all those virtues whatsoever that
adorn her sex.'</p>

<p>Henry, the elder son, appears to have been, on the
whole, a successful man in his profession; he
entered the navy in 1666, and for the next twenty
years sailed in almost as many different ships; he
was made Vice-Admiral of the Blue in 1689, and
finally was created a Lord of the Admiralty under
King William III. He died at his seat at St.
Albans (for which place he had been elected M.P.)
on the 9th November, 1712, eighteen years after his
retirement from the Admiralty. Many MS. letters
by him are in the Bodleian Library, and at All
Souls' College, Oxford. In the British Museum
is preserved a broadside entitled&mdash;</p>

Three.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p class="noind">It was printed 17th September, 1690; on which date
the final result was not known, but enough had been
learnt to describe the engagement as a victory; the
battle was fought three leagues off the shore, and
lasted from 10 a.m. till night.</p>

<p>Macaulay does not refer to this exploit; but, writing
of the year 1693, he tells us that 'Killigrew and
Delaval <em>were Tories</em>, and that the Whigs carried a
vote of censure upon the Government in consequence
of the late naval miscarriages, but failed to
fix it on Killigrew and Delaval themselves, the
Admirals.' The facts seem to have been that Killigrew
and Delaval were appointed to convoy seventy
ships of the line and thirty smaller vessels&mdash;the
richly-freighted Smyrna fleet&mdash;past Brest to the
Mediterranean; Rooke was to take them on afterwards.
But the French fleet lay in wait for them
near Gibraltar, and Rooke fell into the trap, with
dire results. Macaulay thinks that Killigrew and
Delaval ought to have been sharper, and not to have
returned to England so soon. On hearing of the
news in England, many of the merchants went away
from the Royal Exchange 'pale as death.' There is,
however, in the British Museum a rare ballad which
somewhat conflicts with Macaulay's views, and I am
tempted to refer to it, without being able to reconcile
the discrepancy. It is entitled&mdash;</p>

towards Brest. With the manner of Taking Three
of their French Men of War, and sinking Two more;
although the French Admiral vainly boasted he
would recover Brest or Paradice, yet he shamefully
run from the English Fleet. (<em>To the Tune of The
Spinning Wheel.</em>)'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The ballad is illustrated with rough wood-cuts,
three of which represent ships, and a fourth, it is to
be presumed, the Admiral himself. It begins thus:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Here's joyfull news came late from Sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis of a gallant Victory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which o'er the French we did obtain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the throbbing Ocean Main.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As soon as e'er they found our Rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Rogues was glad to disengage.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">The defeat of the attempt made by the Toulon fleet
to join that at Brest is then described, in the same
rude sort of lines eminently adapted for the roystering
choristers who frequent seaside taverns; and the
poet thus continues:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Now while we did maintain the Fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two French Ships there we sunk down right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And likewise have we taken Three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Crown'd our Work with Victory;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noble, valiant <span class="smcap">Killegrew</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the rest do's still pursue.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">And the ballad concludes with the hope&mdash;</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'That we hereafter may advance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shake the very Crown of France.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Possibly it refers to an episode of the fight which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
may have escaped the notice of the illustrious
historian. This much, however, is certain, that
the exploits of the British Admiral were caricatured
in a street play, probably got up for political purposes.</p>

<p>Admiral Killigrew has been described in the
following terms by one G. Wood, his clerk, who
sailed with him to the Mediterranean:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'A young man in the flower of his age but a man of
great experience and to add to his experience he's
a man of undaunted Courage Prudence and Conduct,
making it his study in all his actions to doe nothing
(though never so much to his own advantage) but
that which is truely honorable and altogeither tending
to the honor and advantage of his King and Country.
Hee likewise carry'd his comÃÑand w<sup>th</sup> so much gravity
and wisdome that he was both belov'd and fear'd by
all y<sup>e</sup> squad<sup>n</sup> from y<sup>e</sup> highest to y<sup>e</sup> lowest; and for
his Prudence and Dilligence in managing of his
Ma<sup>tie's</sup> affairs.... I might inlarge much more
and speak nothing but truth of this hono<sup>ble</sup> comand<sup>s</sup>
yett fear I should be look't upon as a flatterer by those
y<sup>t</sup> knows him not.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Whilst serving in the Mediterranean, in chase of a
<em>Salletine</em> frigate, he was severely wounded by the bursting
of a gun in his own ship, the splinters breaking
both bones of his right leg, and frightfully wounding
his head.</p>

<p>I have been unable to ascertain whom Admiral
Henry married; but he had a son who bore the same
name as himself, and who settled at St. Julian's in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Hertfordshire. I think it must have been he who
was a Major in Lord Strafford's Royal Regiment of
Dragoons, the composition of which corps and the pay
of its members are set forth in the Add<sup>l</sup>. MSS. 22,231
in the British Museum. It would, however, be uninteresting
to trace farther the descent of this branch
of the family.</p>

<p>James, the younger brother, when only twenty-one
years of age, and unmarried, was killed in a sea
engagement off Leghorn, in January 1694/5, on board
the <i>Plymouth</i>; like Nelson, 'in the arms of victory.'<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
His ship was a fast sailer, and outstripped her companions,
so that when Captain James Killigrew
came up with the French he had to engage two
ships at once, both bigger than his own, one of
which, however, he sunk, and the other he took. He
sustained the unequal combat, it is said, for four
hours. Besides losing his own life, fifty of his men
were killed and wounded when the remainder of the
British ships at length came up to his assistance.
'Characters like his need no encomium,' observes
Charnock. Some accounts attribute cowardice to
his comrades on this occasion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have now nearly completed our task, and have
come to the last of the Killigrews whose history is
likely to be entertaining, or instructive. ANNE,</p>

<p class="pfs80">'qu√¶ stabat ubique victrix forma, ingenio, religione,'<br /></p>

<p class="noind">as her epitaph (now destroyed) in the chancel of St.
John the Baptist, in the Savoy Chapel, once described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
her;<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and most gratifying it is to close our account
of the Killigrews with the story of this admirable
woman.</p>

<p>She was born in 1660, in St. Martin's Lane; and,
the Restoration not having then been effected, was
(according to Cibber's 'Lives of the Poets') christened
in a private chamber, the offices of the
Common Prayer-book not being at that time
publicly allowed. Early distinguished for her skill
in poetry and in painting, and for her learning,
taste, and purity of life, for her fame she is not indebted
to that which alone would have been sufficient
to perpetuate it&mdash;I mean Dryden's renowned ode.
This, exaggerated as its terms may appear, is nevertheless
said, by those who knew her, to be hardly too
strongly expressed. Even the ascetic Anthony Wood
wrote of her the well-known line,</p>

<p class="pfs80">'A Grace for beauty, and a Muse for wit;'<br /></p>

<p class="noind">and he assures us that 'there is nothing spoken of
her which she was not equal to, if not superior.'
That she was an accomplished artist Dryden's verse
records, and that this was a talent possessed by at
least one of her ancestors we have seen in the
account of Sir Henry Killigrew, the diplomatist; but
I am not aware that any of her paintings remain to
us; but Walpole saw her portrait by herself, and
thought more highly of her painting than of her
poetry. The portrait has been admirably engraved
in mezzotint by Becket and by Blooteling. She
painted James II. and his Queen, as well as several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
'history-pieces,' landscapes, and still-life subjects,
which Dryden mentions in the poem that Dr. Johnson
pronounced 'the noblest ode that our language has
produced.' I am aware that Warton somewhat differs
from the great critic as to this; but it would be difficult
to point to a finer English threnody; and, notwithstanding
the probability of its being familiar, if not
to all, yet to most of my readers, I venture to think
that the reproduction here of such parts as particularly
refer to Anne Killigrew may not be unacceptable.
The noble strain thus opens:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">Exaggerated language perhaps, but sincerely
meant. And the master of the 'long-resounding
line' concludes:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When in mid-air the golden trump shall sound,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">The allusion to the grief of her brother Henry, the
Admiral, then at sea, is very fine:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Meantime her warlike brother on the seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His waving streamers to the wind displays,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Alas! thou know'st not&mdash;<em>thou art wrecked at home</em>.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">Her skill as a painter he depicts in the following
happy lines:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Her pencil drew whate'er her soul designed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft the happy draught surpass'd the image in her mind.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
<span class="i4">The sylvan scenes of herds and flocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The fruitful plains, and barren rocks;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of shallow brooks that flowed so clear<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The bottom did the top appear:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of deeper, too, and ampler floods,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Which, as in mirrors, showed the woods:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of lofty trees with sacred shades,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And perspectives of pleasant glades,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Where nymphs of brightest form appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And shaggy satyrs standing near,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Which them at once admire and fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ruins, too, of some majestic piece<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boasting the power of ancient Rome or Greece;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose statues, friezes, columns, broken lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, though defaced, the wonder of the eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What Nature, Art, bold Fiction e'er durst frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her forming hand gave feature to the name.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">Dryden then alludes to her portraits of the royal
family&mdash;and first of the King:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'For, not content to express his outward part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hand called out the image of his heart.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">Of his Consort's likeness the poet gracefully observes:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Our ph&oelig;nix Queen was pourtrayed, too, so bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauty alone could beauty take so right.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">And, with a grand hyperbole, the poem ends with
the above prediction that at the last day the Poets
shall first awake at the sound in mid-air of the
golden trump:</p>

<p class="pfs80">'For they are covered with the lightest ground.'<br /></p>

<p>Mistress Anne Killigrew, as the virgin poetess and
paintress was called, after the fashion of the time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
was, like so many others of her family, attached to
the Court. She was Maid of Honour to the Duchess
of York; and, even in those loose days, was unspotted
by the contaminating influences amongst which she
found herself. One other taint, however, she did not
escape&mdash;the contagion of small-pox, of which horrible
malady this 'cynosure' died at her father's prebendal
house in the Cloister of Westminster Abbey,
on the 16th June, 1685, in the twenty-fifth year of
her age.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>To her 'Poems,' now a rare book&mdash;a thin quarto,
which appeared shortly after her death&mdash;are prefixed
Dryden's ode, and the mezzotint by Becket,
after her portrait of herself. Sir Peter Lely also
painted her likeness.</p>

<p>It has already been said that none of her paintings
remain; but of her poetical powers we may still judge
from the following extracts. They will, of course, fall
somewhat flat after the lofty lines which have just
been cited; yet I venture to think that they will be
found worthy of perusal. At any rate, Dryden
writes,</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Thy father was transfused into thy blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So wert thou born into a tuneful strain;'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">and they were at least considered at the time
sufficiently good for the insinuation that they were
not her own&mdash;a calumny to which the gentle Anne
replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p class="pfs80 wordsp">'UPON THE SAYING THAT MY VERSES WERE MADE

<span class="i0">I willingly accept Cassandra's Fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speak the Truth, although believ'd too late.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">The following lines also are, I venture to think, far
from commonplace:</p>

<p class="pfs80 wordsp">'AN ODE.</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Arise, my Dove, from midst of Pots arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thy sully'd Habitation leave,<br /></span>

<span class="i6">Than burnisht Gold more bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus ever ready stand to take thy Eternal Flight.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding her modesty, she was not without
some confidence that her poetry would survive her,
as it has, in fact, already done for two centuries; for
thus she wrote her own epitaph:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When I am Dead, few friends attend my Hearse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for a Monument I leave my <em>Verse</em>;'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">a monument, perhaps, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">√¶re perennium</i>, and which
certainly remains longer than the marble cenotaph
which was destroyed by the fire in the Savoy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Epitaphs, indeed, seem to have had a charm for
her, as if she had a foreboding of her early death;
and the following lines in praise of Mrs. Phillips
may serve for a fair description of herself, and as a
finish to these extracts from her compositions:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Orinda (Albion's and her sex's grace)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Owed not her glory to a beauteous face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was her radiant <em>soul</em> that shone within;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which struck a lustre through her outward skin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That did her lips and cheeks with roses dye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advanced her height, and sparkled in her eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did her sex at all obstruct her fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But higher 'mong the stars it fixed her name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What she did write, not only all allowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But every laurel to her laurel bowed.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps too much has been said of the virtues and
graces of this chaste and accomplished lady; but it
must be remembered that women such as she were
rare in the days in which she lived and wrote. Nor
must we forget that we are far removed from the
sphere of that <em>personal</em> influence, the attractions
of which are so powerful, and which probably
contributed in no small degree to the fame of this
fair scion of the Killigrews.</p>

<p>It was written on her epitaph, according to Ballard:</p>

<div lang="la" xml:lang="la" class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Abi, Viator, et plange,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">Even at this distance of time, it is delightful to
think that she left a wicked world and age before
a single spot had dimmed the lustre of her widely
admired, but unsullied, fame:</p>

<p class="pfs80">'Wearing the white flower of a blameless life.'<br /></p>
<p class="p4" />

as 'Levine Prisklo,'&mdash;which was once the well-filled swannery of the
Killigrews. It was moved in 1836 to make way for the houses now

who is mentioned in the Journals of Roger Machado, of an embassy
to Spain and Portugal, in 1488, as having entertained the traveller,
whom stress of weather drove into Falmouth harbour; and as having
bequeathed, in the year 1500, one hundred marks for the rebuilding of
St. Budock Church. In the autumn of 1882, whilst restoring St. Gluvias
Church, the workmen came upon some leaden coffins in good preservation,

<p><a name="Footnote_84" id="Footnote_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_84"><span class="label">[84]</span></a> On April 8th, 1663, at the New Theatre in Drury Lane, the prices of
admission were: boxes, 4s.; pit, 2s. 6d.; middle gallery, 1s. 6d.; upper
gallery, 1s. The play began at 3 p.m., the prices not so very different
from those at present, except that the pit seems to be proportionately
dearer. The company at first consisted, so Mr. Froude says, of actors
from the old 'Red Bull,' with additions from Rhodes's. Nell Gwynne
and Mrs. Knepp (Pepys' Knip) were amongst them. I am indebted
to my friend, Dr. G. Fielding Blandford, for the following information
as to the site of the building:&mdash;'Killigrew converted Charles Gibbons'
Tennis Court into a theatre in 1660. It was in Bear Yard, Vere Street,
Clare Market, and was opened 8th November, 1660, with the play of
"Henry IV." Pepys was there November 20th, and saw the play of
"Beggar's Bush," and, for the first time, Mohun (known as Major
Mohun), "said to be the best actor in the world." Here (January 3rd,
1661) he, for the first time, saw women on the stage. He calls it in
other places the New Theatre, and says "it is the finest playhouse, I
believe, that ever was in England." The names of the actors are given
in the rate-books of St. Clement Danes for 1663. This theatre is not
to be confounded (as it often is) with the one subsequently built in
Portugal Row, and known as the Duke's Theatre. This is now the
site of the Hunterian Museum. I believe the first theatre of that name
only existed a few years.'</p></div>

<p class="drop-capi2"><span class="smcap">The</span>
 interest which was felt in a portrait of
Henry Bone, R.A., which I had the pleasure
of presenting to the Royal Institution
of Cornwall, induced me to offer for the
acceptance of that Society the portraits of two other
Truro worthies; which I thought (though the engravings
possess no great merit as works of art) might
at least serve as reminders of the energy, skill, and
determination possessed by two Truro men&mdash;half a
century ago;<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and, almost as a matter of course,
Richard Lander's name found a place among the
Cornish Worthies, whose stories I am attempting
to write. I am just old enough to remember
the commencement, on the 16th June, 1835, of the
erection of the column designed by P. Sambell, jun.,
to the memory of Richard Lander, which stands at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the top of Lemon Street, and (owing to bad workmanship)
the fall of a considerable portion of it on
the 21st of May, 1836. Amongst other reminiscences
I may perhaps also mention that my father
has told me that, on the occasion of laying the
foundation-stone of the column, he was one of those
who formed the procession, and that he and the late
Mr. Humphry Willyams, of Carnanton, then led by
the hand Richard Lander's child. On that occasion,
as on a more recent one of higher importance
at Truro, viz., the laying of the foundation-stone of
the new Cathedral, the Masonic ceremony was
followed by a religious service.</p>

<p>Although generally spoken of as the Brothers
Lander, it should be borne in mind that to Richard,
the elder brother, the world is mainly indebted for
the discovery of the course of the lower portion of
'the lordly Niger' (as Longfellow calls the river).
John, the younger brother, had considerable powers
of observation and some poetic taste, and was by
trade a printer. He accompanied Richard simply
from affectionate motives (and certainly without
promise of any pecuniary reward), on the <em>second</em> of
Richard's three expeditions to Africa, from which
the brothers returned safely; but John will appear no
further (except incidentally) in the remarks which I
have to offer. He was born in 1807, and died in
1839 in consequence of illness contracted during his
one voyage to Africa.</p>

<p><em>Richard Lemon Lander</em>, the heroic but unfortunate
traveller, whose name will ever be associated with
the splendid discovery of the course and termination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of that mysterious and fatal river, which some of
the ancients confounded with the Nile, and which
the Moors of Northern Africa still call 'the Nile
of the Negroes,'<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> was the fourth of six children,
and was born at his father's house, the 'Dolphin
Inn,' Truro (then called 'The Fighting Cocks'), on
the 8th February, 1804, the day on which Colonel
Lemon was elected M.P. for the town. Hence his
second name; and hence also a certain appropriateness
in the site which was chosen at the top of
Lemon Street for his statue, the work of a Cornish
sculptor, the late N. N. Burnard. In the midst of
his unfeigned humility in his account of his parents,
he nevertheless boasts that, as his father's name
began with a <em>Lan</em> and his mother's maiden name
(Penrose) with a <em>Pen</em>, no one could deny his claim
to being a right <em>Cornishman</em>. But Colonel J. Lambrick
Vivian informs me that Lander came from an
older and a better stock than he was himself aware
of. The family can be traced, in St. Just at least, as
early as 1619, at which time a Richard Lander
married Thomasine Bosaverne, one of a good old
Cornish family. The Polwheles and Landers also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
intermarried. Richard's grandfather, a noted
wrestler, lived near the Land's End.</p>

<p>Of Lander's early life in Truro I can learn little
further than that he went to "old Pascoe's" school
in Coomb's Lane, and was one of those few
favourites of his master, who was thought worthy to
receive one of the then newly-coined 1s. 6d. pieces.
Richard seems to have been a merry, bright-eyed
lad, somewhat below the usual height,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> but he was
always of a roving, adventurous spirit, and, when
only eleven years old, accompanied a merchant to
the West Indies, whence, after a residence there of
three years, and having been attacked by fever in St.
Domingo, he returned to England in 1818, and lived
as a servant in various wealthy families, with some
of whom he visited the continent of Europe.</p>

<p>In 1823 he went with Major Colebrook (one of
the Royal Commissioners of inquiry into the state
of the British Colonies) to the Cape of Good
Hope, and returned to England in the following
year. In 1825, when Captain Clapperton and
Major Denham returned from their travels in the
interior of Africa, Lander, charmed, as he says, by
the very sound of the word 'Africa,' and impelled
by his inborn love of adventure, offered to accompany
the former officer in a second expedition to
that continent, notwithstanding the efforts of all his
friends to dissuade him. Amongst these may be
mentioned Mr. George Croker Fox, who offered
Lander, by way of a counter-temptation, a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
lucrative post in South America. However, Lander's
proposal was gladly accepted by Clapperton,
and the adventurous youngster remained with his
employer up to the hour of the Captain's death at
Soccatoo, in the interior, in April, 1827. He then
made his homeward-way, alone, by land to Badagry
on the coast, and arrived at Portsmouth with Clapperton's
papers in April, 1828, much debilitated by
fevers contracted during his long sojourn in a pestiferous
climate.</p>

<p>In the December of the following year Richard
Lander published a most entertaining account of his
travels, dating the first part of the introduction to the
book, 'Truro, Oct. 29th, 1829.' To this work is prefixed
his portrait, in his Eastern travelling costume.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now comes his most important voyage of discovery.
Having arranged, under the auspices of
the Government, a second expedition to West
Africa, not only with a view to commerce, but also
in the hope of doing something which should
lead to the suppression of the slave-trade and of
human sacrifices, he embarked with his brother
John in the merchant-vessel <i>Alert</i> at Portsmouth, on
the 8th January, 1830. He says the party went out
'with the fixed determination to risk everything,
even life itself, towards the final accomplishment of
their object. Confidence in ourselves and in the
natives will be our best panoply, and an English
Testament our best fetish.' The Colonial Secretary
granted an allowance of ¬£100 a year to Mrs. Richard
Lander during her husband's absence, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
traveller was himself to receive a gratuity of ¬£100 on
his return to England. The little expedition arrived
at Cape Coast Castle on the 22nd February, 1830,
and was conveyed thence on board H.M.'s Brig
<i>Clinker</i> to Accra, where they landed on the 22nd
March. On the 17th June, after a toilsome and
dangerous journey overland, they reached Boussa on
the West bank of the Niger, the place where, it will
be remembered, Mungo Park met with a similar
fate to that which was ultimately to befall Lander.
Thence they ascended the river to Yaoorie, a distance
of about 100 miles; and this place, the
extreme point of the expedition, they reached on the
27th June. On the 2nd August they returned to
Boussa, where they embarked in canoes in order to
descend the stream&mdash;considering that such a method
must at last solve the mighty problem somehow&mdash;though
of course in utter uncertainty as to whither
the stream might lead them.</p>

<p>As they proceeded, difficulties and dangers increased.
At Kirree they were plundered and cruelly
ill-treated; and at Eboe they were made prisoners by
the Negro King, who demanded a large sum for their
ransom, which, after long delay, was procured. At
length they reached the mouth of the Nun branch of
the Niger; and on the 1st December, 1830, they
were put on shore at Fernando Po; and ultimately,
after first visiting Rio Janeiro, they reached Portsmouth
on the 9th June, 1831.</p>

<p>So triumphant a result naturally excited the public
interest; and it is stated that Murray, the eminent
publisher, offered the Landers 1000 guineas for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
papers; the offer was accepted, and the task of
blending the brothers' two journals into one, and of
constructing a map of their route, having been performed
by Lieutenant Beecher, R.N., the work, in
three volumes, was published in 1832 as No. 28 of
the Family Library, and has been translated into
French, German, Dutch, and Swedish. For his valuable
discoveries Richard Lander received from the
Royal Geographical Society its first annual premium
of fifty guineas, presented by King William IV.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to note here the following
description of the scenery of the lower Niger, translated
from a recent work by a Belgian traveller&mdash;Adolphe
Burdo:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'It is a grand and beautiful river, as it rolls
majestically along, widening at every step, while its
banks display all the splendours of the African flora.
The birds have re-appeared, and enliven us with
their songs or cries; in the distance the proud
cocoa-nut palms lift their superb heads against the
azure sky; the dwarf date-palms bathe their curious
foliage in the waters; sitting motionless on the
young green trunks the pale blue kingfishers keep
watch for incautious fish or wandering flies; a
thousand birds with variegated plumage, some
yellow with a black necklace, others with gay crests,
flutter joyously among the trees; great <em>bombax</em> or
cotton-trees sway to and fro, their thick foliage
forming clusters; manchineels, whose red blossoms
set off the verdure; and finally the bananas, whose
large leaves reveal the existence of a negro village
behind the screen which they form.'</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Commerce with the rich interior of Africa now at
length seemed practicable; and accordingly, with
this view, early in 1832 several Liverpool merchants
formed a company, and arranged a trading expedition
up the Niger, which was placed under the direction
of Richard Lander. This expedition consisted of
two iron steam-vessels, the <i>Quorra</i> ('Shining River'),
of 145 tons, and the <i>Alburka</i> ('Blessing') measuring
only 55. They were accompanied as far as the Gulf
of Guinea by a brig laden with coals for the
steamers, and a variety of articles for presents or
barter. The little squadron sailed from Milford
Haven on 25th July, 1832, and reached Cape Coast
Castle on 7th October. After innumerable mishaps,
and fearful prostrations by illnesses caused by the
unhealthy climate, but having succeeded in tracing
the Niger (this time <em>upwards</em>) for a considerable portion
of its course, Lander returned for a short time
to Fernando Po for further supplies of cowries,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> etc.,
leaving the steamers in charge of Surgeon Oldfield.</p>

<p>Having obtained what he required, he started on
his return and final voyage, of which the following
is a summary.</p>

<p>Early in 1834 Lander left Fernando Po in the
<i>Craven</i> cutter with four hundred pounds' worth of
goods to rejoin the <i>Alburka</i>. On arriving at the
Nun mouth of the Niger he quitted the <i>Craven</i>, and
with his companions began ascending the river in
two canoes of different sizes. All the party were in
excellent spirits. With them were two or three negro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
musicians, who, when the labours of the day were
over, cheered their countrymen with their instruments,
to the sound of which they danced and sang
in company, while the few Englishmen belonging to
the party amused themselves with angling on the
banks of the stream; thus, stemming a strong
current by day, and resting from their toil at night,
Lander and his little band, totally unapprehensive of
danger, and unprepared to overcome or meet it,
proceeded slowly up the stream. At some distance
from its mouth they met King Jacket, a relation of
King Boy, one of the heartless and sullen chiefs who
ruled over a large tract of the slimy, poisonous
marshes which border the Brass River. This
personage was hailed by our travellers, and a present
of tobacco and rum was offered him: he accepted
it with a murmur of dissatisfaction, and his eyes
sparkled with malignity as he said in his own
language: "White man will never reach Eboe this
time." This sentence was immediately interpreted
to Lander by a native of the country (a boy, who
afterwards bled to death from a wound in the knee);
but Lander made light of the matter, and attributed
King Jacket's prophecy (for so it proved to be) to
the petulance and malice of his disposition. Soon,
however, he discovered his error; but too late to evade
the danger which threatened him. On ascending
the river sixty or seventy miles further, the Englishman
approached an island near Ingiamma, near
where the progress of the larger canoe was effectually
obstructed by the shallowness of the stream.
Amongst the trees and underwood which grew on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
this island, and on both banks of the river in its
vicinity, large ambuscades of the natives had previously
been formed, and shortly after the principal
canoe had grounded, its unfortunate crew, busily
occupied in endeavouring to get it into deeper
water, were saluted with irregular but heavy and
continued discharges of musketry. So great was
Lander's confidence in the sincerity and goodwill of
the natives that he could not at first believe that the
destructive fire by which he was literally surrounded
was anything more than a mode of salutation they
had adopted in honour of his arrival. But the
Kroomen who had leaped into the boat, and who
fell wounded by his side, convinced him of his
mistake, and plainly discovered to him the fearful
nature of the peril into which he had fallen so unexpectedly,
as well as the difficulty he would experience
in extricating himself from it. But, encouraging
his comrades with his voice and gestures,
the traveller prepared to defend himself to the last;
and a loud and simultaneous shout from his little
party assured him that they shared his feelings, and
would follow his example. Meanwhile, several of
the savages having come out from their concealment,
were brought down by the shots of the English;
but Lander, whilst stooping to pick up a cartridge
from the bottom of the canoe, was struck near the
hip by a musket-ball. The shock made him stagger;
but he did not fall, and he continued cheering on
his men. Soon, however, finding his ammunition
expended, himself seriously wounded, the courage of
his Kroomen beginning to droop, and the firing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
his assailants instead of diminishing become more
general, he resolved to attempt getting into the
smaller canoe, afloat at a short distance, as the only
remaining chance of preserving a single life. For
this purpose, abandoning their property, the survivors
threw themselves into the stream, and with
much difficulty (for the strength of the current was
enormous) most of them succeeded in accomplishing
their object. No sooner was this observed by the
natives in ambush than they started up and rushed
out with loud and hideous yells; some Bonny, Brass,
and Benin canoes that had been hidden behind the
luxuriant foliage which overhung the river were, in
an instant, pushed out into the middle of the current,
and pursued the fugitives with surprising velocity;
while numbers of savages, with wild antics and
furious gesticulations, ran and danced along the
beach, uttering loud and startling cries. The Kroomen
maintained on this occasion the good reputation
which their countrymen have deservedly acquired:
the lives of the whole party depended on these men's
energy and skill, and they impelled the slender
barque through the water with unrivalled swiftness.</p>

<p>The pursuit was kept up for four hours; and poor
Lander, with only wet ammunition, and with no
defensive weapons whatever, was exposed to the
straggling fire, as well as the insulting mockery of
his pursuers. The fugitives, however, outstripped
their pursuers, and when they found the chase discontinued
altogether, Lander stood up, <em>for the last
time</em>, in the canoe; and, being seconded by his remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
associates, he waved his hat and gave a last
cheer in sight of his adversaries. He then became
sick and faint from loss of blood, and sank back
exhausted in the arms of those who were nearest
to him. Rallying shortly afterwards, the nature of
his wound was communicated to him by Mr. Moore,
a young surgeon from England, who had accompanied
him up the river, viz., that the ball could not
be extracted; it had worked its way into the left
thigh, and Lander felt convinced that his career
would soon be terminated. When the state of
excitement to which his feelings had been wrought
gave place to the languor which generally succeeds
powerful excitement of any kind, the invalid's wound
pained him exceedingly, and for several hours afterwards
he endured, though with calmness, the most
intense sufferings. From that time he could neither
sit up nor turn on his couch; but while he was
proceeding down the river in a manner so melancholy,
and so very different from the mode in which
he was ascending it only the day before, he could
not help indulging in mournful reflections: he talked
much of his wife, his child, his friends, his distant
home, and his blighted expectations. It was a
period of darkness, distress, and sorrow to him; but
his natural cheerfulness soon regained its ascendency
over his mind, and, freely forgiving all his enemies,
he resigned himself into the hands of his Maker.
At length, having succeeded in escaping down the
stream, Lander reached Fernando Po on the 27th of
January. After his arrival he was doing so well,
that, on the very day previous to his death, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
occurred on the 6th of February, 1834,<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> he took
food with appetite, and no doubt was entertained
of his recovery. But mortification of the wound
suddenly set in, and all hope was abandoned. So
rapid was his prostration, that he died soon after
midnight; having given such directions respecting
his affairs as the shortness of the last fatal warning
permitted. While on his sick-bed, every needful and
possible aid was afforded him. In the airiest room
of Colonel Nicholl's residence, receiving the unremitting
attention of that humane and gallant officer
(the Governor of Fernando Po), with the best medical
assistance, and the most soothing services, his pains
were alleviated and his spirits were cheered. He
was conscious of his approaching dissolution, talked
with calmness to those around him, and anticipated
the termination of his career with composure and
with hope. His body was laid in the grave at the
Clarence Cemetery amid the vivid regrets of the
whole population, who accompanied the funeral.</p>

<p>An account of this voyage, which Lander had
promised should be his <em>last</em>&mdash;though he did not
anticipate its <em>fatal</em> termination&mdash;was published by
Messrs. Laird and Oldfield, the only surviving
officers of the expedition, in 1835; but I have
been obliged to obtain the foregoing account of the
attack at Ingiamma, and the death of Richard
Lander, from other sources. Messrs. Laird and
Oldfield's work is illustrated by another, containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
eleven views and maps by Commander W. Allen,
R.N., published by Murray in 1840.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Though the subject of these notes seems to have
been in every sense the life and soul of the expedition,
yet, as the French writer Lanoye tartly pointed out,
at the time of his writing poor Lander's grave in the
cemetery of Fernando Po was undistinguished by any
monument; nor do I know whether or not this omission
has even yet been rectified. 'A solitary palm
tree,' says Baikie,<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> 'marks the spot where this
heroic traveller and most intrepid pioneer of civilization
fell;' but the village itself from which the attack
was delivered has, I believe, been moved about a
quarter of a mile farther up the river.</p>

<p>The Royal Geographical Society, however, has not
been unmindful of Lander's claim to a place in the
front rank of discoverers, and have fixed in the
Chapel Royal, Savoy, a stained glass memorial
window, the subjects of which are the Transfiguration
and the Last Supper, with the following inscription:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p class="small">'In memory of Richard Lemon Lander, the discoverer of the
source of the Niger, and the first Gold Medallist of the Royal Geographical
Society.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> He was born at Truro, in 1804, and died in the
Island of Fernando Po in 1834, from wounds inflicted by the natives.
This window is inserted by her Majesty's permission by some of his
relations and friends, and by some of the Fellows of the Royal
Geographical Society.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>This was in substitution for the tablet erected in 1834,
and destroyed by the fire of 7th July, 1864.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>His native place has not forgotten his fame, as the
Doric column at Truro surmounted by his statue testifies.
The plate on the foundation-stone bore this
inscription: 'To honour the enterprise and sufferings
of the brothers Richard and John Lander,
natives of this town, and to commemorate the early
fate of Richard, who perished on the Quorra,
√Ütat. 30.' And his name has been given to two
places on the Niger. That he did not himself forget
his Cornish home is clear from his having named an
island on the river '<em>Truro</em> Island,' and one of the
high hills on its banks, '<em>Cornwall</em> Mountain.'</p>

<p>A writer in the 'Annual Biography and Obituary'
for 1834 says of him that 'Richard Lander was of
short stature, but he possessed great muscular
strength, and a constitution of iron.' No stranger
could help being 'struck (as Sir Joseph Banks was
with Ledyard) with the breadth of his chest, the
openness of his countenance, and the restlessness of
his eye. He was gifted in an eminent degree with
that passive courage which is so requisite a qualification
in an African traveller. His manners were
mild, unobtrusive, and highly pleasing, which, joined
to his cheerful temper and ingenuous handsome
countenance, rendered him a favourite with everyone
that knew him, by most of whom he was
beloved in the fullest sense of that word.'</p>

<p>So greatly was Richard Lander beloved by the
untutored Africans, that at various places in the
interior where he had remained some time, as at
Katunga, Boussa, Yaoorie, numbers of the inhabitants
ran out of their huts to embrace him on his leaving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and with hands uplifted, and eyes filled with tears,
they blessed him in the name of their gods.</p>

<p>The <cite>Literary Gazette</cite> for 3rd May, 1834, had the
following observations on Lander's death: 'Thus
has another sacrifice to African discovery been made:
a man whose character was of the highest human
stamp. Calm and resolute, steady and fearless, bold
and adventurous, never did there exist a more fit
instrument for the undertaking of such exploits as
those which have shed a lustre over his humble name.
We cannot express the sorrow with which the sad
calamity has filled us&mdash;it is a deep <em>private</em> affliction,
and a lasting <em>national</em> regret.'</p>

<p>A pension of ¬£70 a year was granted by the
Government to Lander's widow, and a donation of
¬£50 to his daughter; and a sum of 80 guineas which
had been collected in Truro (with a view to presenting
the Landers with a piece of plate) was diverted
towards the cost of erecting the Lander column. An
infant son of the same name died the same year as
his father, and was buried in the churchyard of the
Savoy.</p>

<p>I do not know that I can more suitably conclude
these imperfect remarks than by quoting the following
touching letter&mdash;I believe the last he ever wrote&mdash;as
an illustration of his amiable, unselfish character:</p>

natives of Hyammah off the fourth island from Sunday
Island (eighty-four miles from the mouth of the
Nun). The shot were very numerous both from the
island and shore, Mrs. Brown and child were
taken prisoners, whom I was bringing up to her
husband, as well as Robert the boy. I have advanced
King Boy money to go and purchase them; the

<p>'We had 3 men shot dead: Thomson, second
mate of the cutter, one Krooman, and one Cape
Coastman. I am wounded, but I hope not dangerously,
the ball having entered close to the "bottom

extracted yet. Thos. Oxford is wounded in the
groin, two Kroomen wounded dangerously and one
slightly. I am sorry to say I lost all my papers and
everything belonging to me, the boat and one canoe;
having escaped in one of the canoes barely with a coat
to our backs, they chasing us in their war-canoes; and
all our cartridges being wet, we could not keep them
off. They attacked us at 3 p.m. on the 20th January,
and left us at 8 at night. We pulled all night and
reached the cutter on the 21st. We are now under
weigh for Fernando Po.</p>

<p>Such was the fate of one who may be not unfairly
described as one of the chief, if not the chief, of the
pioneers of West African exploration. It is evident
that access to the interior of the Dark Continent continues
to engage the attention of travellers; for,
according to the comments of a recent writer on the
meeting of the Royal Geographical Society in May,
1883:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'Africa has at no period of its history been so
flooded with eager seekers after the unknown as at
the present hour. Apart from the explorations for
commercial and political purposes that are being
carried out by French officers in Senegambia and on
the Upper Niger and Congo, a Russian expedition
under Rogozinzki, and an Italian one under Bianchi
and Licata, have been planned to enter the country at
the Bight of Biafra. These expeditions will probably
be absent several years, for they are organized
with the object of crossing through the unknown
region between the Congo, the Benueh, and Lake
Tchad, and of so eventually reaching Abyssinia.
Numerous other travellers are either in the interior
or making for the goal as best they can; and Mr.
Stanley, in pursuance of his mission on the Upper
Congo, is understood to have made a voyage up one of
its greatest tributaries, and discovered a hitherto unsuspected
lake of considerable magnitude. Another
such sheet of water is believed to be not far from the
Welle; and now that Mr. Joseph Thomson and Dr.
Fischer are far on their way to examine the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
between the sea and the northern end of Lake
Nyassa, the snow-capped Mounts Kenia and Kilimandjaro
promise before long to be removed from
the region of myth. Messrs. O'Neill, Johnson, and
Stewart's explorations in the same quarter are
adding much to our acquaintance with a country
hitherto little known, and as soon as the steamer
can be carried in sections across the road cut
between Nyassa and Tanganyika, the latter lake
will become almost as well surveyed as Lakes Huron
or Superior. Holub intends boring from one end of
Africa to another, and without doing more than
mentioning a few of the names which most readily
suggest themselves, B√∂hm, Kaiser, Stecker, Giraud,
Aubrey, Hamon, Revoil, and Schuver are among
the many eager, and in most cases tried, explorers
whose efforts or achievements in different parts of
Africa during the past year deserve special remark.
The scheme of international stations, started and
carried out by the committee presided over by
King Leopold, is rapidly joining the East and West
Coast by a chain of civilized settlements, where the
rude tribes can learn the arts of peace, and the
weary explorers find the succour and assistance
denied to their predecessors from the hour they
entered the Dark Continent. Africa must before
long become permeated with what Europeans call
light, and, though the accounts of later travellers
do not confirm the sanguine estimates of the earlier
pioneers, the resources of its great forests, rich
valleys, and mineral veins are at least capable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
supporting a vastly greater trade than the country
at present enjoys.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Whatever may be the future of Africa, Richard
Lander's name will always be remembered as that of
one of the earliest and bravest of her explorers.</p>

<p class="drop-capi2"><span class="smcap">Anyone</span> who would write the life of Henry
Martyn, must feel that he is about to
tread upon holy ground. For, however
clearly we may see, on perusing his
'Journals and Letters,'<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> that his introspection was
morbidly minute, his temper naturally irritable, and
his religious views generally of the gloomiest as well
as of an almost impracticable character, yet his
ardent zeal, his saint-like devotion, his self-denial,
and his deep humility, afford such an example of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
earnest piety as is rarely to be met with in the annals
of the Church, since the days of the Apostles themselves.
His very faults were but 'the shadows of
his virtues,' and of Henry Martyn it might truly be
said that to him&mdash;without religion&mdash;</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The pillared firmament was rottenness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And earth's base built on stubble.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>How much of this was due to that frequent correlation
which, as Mr. Galton points out, frequently
exists between an unusually devout disposition and a
weak constitution, it would of course be hard to say.</p>

<p>I cannot help thinking that Martyn has been a
little unfortunate in his biographer, the Rev. John
Sargent, jun., although that writer's 'Memoir' has
been so popular that I believe it has run through
about a score of editions. There was a tardy apology
for the tone of the book in the preface to the tenth edition&mdash;and
an explanation to the effect that Martyn's
religion was really by no means of a desponding character,
and that few persons 'have equalled him in
the enjoyment of that "peace which passeth all
understanding."' If such were the case it is unfortunate
that the extracts made by Mr. Sargent from
Martyn's 'Journals' should have left so wide-spread an
impression to the contrary&mdash;an impression which it
is probably as fruitless to attempt to counteract as
Mr. Sargent expected it would be.</p>

<p>Sargent appears to have sympathized chiefly
with one side of Martyn's character, namely, the
gloomy and self-torturing one, and the result is
that to read the 'Memoir' harrows one's feelings.
Very similar remarks apply to the 'Journals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and Letters,' but in the latter, at least, we have only
the man himself, and are spared the somewhat complacent
tone in which his mental anguish and physical
sufferings are depicted by his friend and biographer.
Charles Kingsley used to say of Martyn: 'My mind
is in a chaos about him. Sometimes one feels inclined
to take him at his own word, and believe him,
as he says, a mere hypochondriac; then the next
moment he seems a saint. I cannot fathom it. Of
this, however, I am certain, that he was a much
better man than I am.' One great lesson, however,
of this learned, brave, and good man's life&mdash;crowned
as it surely was with the crown of the martyr, if
ever mortal's brow were so adorned&mdash;appears to
me to be this: that a life of seclusion, nay, almost
isolation, such as his, defeats its own object, if that
object be, like Martyn's, to influence our fellow-men.
'It is miserable,' he used to say, when thinking of
the vast amount of sin there was in the world, 'it is
miserable living with men;' and, again, 'a dried leaf
or a straw makes me feel in good company.' And
herein seems to lie a great difference between Martyn,
notwithstanding his learning, his piety, and his
dauntless courage amidst incessant perils, and such
heroic Christian missionaries as were St. Paul and
Bishop Heber, who had learnt to mix more freely with
their fellow-men, and to combine the wisdom of the
serpent with the harmlessness of the dove.</p>

<p>But to turn to the life itself. Henry Martyn, like
Martin Luther, sprang from a family of mine captains,
and was born at Truro, on Feb. 18th, 1781&mdash;the
third child of a family of four. His father, who lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
at first near Gwennap Church-Town, had been an
Accountant at Wheal Virgin; and being, like many others
of his calling, an ingenious and self-reliant
man, taught himself arithmetic and some mathematics;
his abilities attracted the attention of Mr.
Daniell, one of the Truro merchants, and ultimately
John Martyn became his chief clerk. 'The elder
Martyn,' Polwhele says, 'was a tall, erect man,
used to take his daily exercise under the Coinage
Hall, which was opposite his house.' The house
was pulled down to make room for the new Town
Hall; it occupied the site of the present Police
Station, as I am informed. Henry's great-uncle,
Thomas Martyn, was the author of the large and
excellent Map of Cornwall, known by his name.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> He
was a surveyor, and his map is said to have been the
result of fifteen years' labour&mdash;the survey having been
made on foot. He died in 1752-53. Henry's mother,
from whom he seems to have inherited his delicate
constitution, was a Miss Fleming of Ilfracombe;
she died the year after he was born.</p>

<p>Henry Martyn&mdash;'little Henry Martyn,' as his
schoolfellows used tenderly to call him&mdash;was sent
at Midsummer, 1788, to that capital nest of so large
a number of our most distinguished Cornishmen&mdash;the
Truro Grammar School&mdash;and he is thus described by
one of his fellow-pupils, the late Clement Carlyon,
M.D., Fellow of Pembroke College, and thrice Mayor
of Truro, in his 'Early Years and Late Reflections:'
'A good-humoured, plain little fellow, with red eyelids
devoid of eye-lashes, and indicative of a scrofulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
habit; and with hands so thickly covered with
warts that it was impossible for him to keep them
clean, or for his respected master,<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> who borrowed a
large leaf out of Dr. Busby's book, to inflict on him,
when idle, stripes over the back of his hand.' He
seems to have improved in appearance as he grew
older; but was always 'rather low in stature, and
plain in person, though not disagreeably so;<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> whilst
his amiable disposition<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and sociability ensured him
the esteem and friendship of all who were acquainted
with him.' Though all his life long he was particularly
fond of laughing and playing with little children,
at school he seldom played with the other boys; and
seems to have evinced no precocity, nor was he very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>studious, like his friend and school-fellow Kempthorne<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
(Senior Wrangler of 1796, and afterwards vicar of
a church in Gloucester): nor did Martyn display the
poetic vein of another of his colleagues, Humphry
Davy.</p>

<p>At the Truro Grammar School, having failed in
1795 to obtain a Scholarship at Corpus Christi
College, Oxford, he remained till 1797, in which
year he took up residence at St. John's College,
Cambridge, where, from his assiduity, he was
known as 'the man who had never lost an hour,'
and was at once fortunate in securing the advice and
friendship of his old acquaintance Kempthorne, who,
as well as Martyn himself, soon came within the
influence of a very earnest Low Church Divine, the
Rev. Charles Simeon, a fellow of King's College, of
whom it is only right to add that he more than once
warned Martyn, whilst in the East, that he was overtaxing
his strength and energies. To this clergyman
Martyn was afterwards to become curate.</p>

<p>The death of his father in 1800 led Martyn to
study the Bible most seriously; and he so read its
pages as to determine upon basing his whole life
upon its promises. He says, for instance, of his
magnificent success in becoming the Senior Wrangler
of his year (and that year was a distinguished one
in the annals of the University): 'I obtained my
highest wishes, but was surprised to find I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
grasped a shadow!' Indeed, it is said that, when
he entered the Senate House for the examination,
and saw the unusually large number assembled there,
he ejaculated, with apparently some inconsistency,
the text: 'Seekest thou great things for thyself?
seek them not, saith the Lord.' In 1802 he became
Fellow and Tutor of his college, and gained the first
prize for Latin prose composition, thus compensating
amply for his lack of success in 1799, when he
failed to obtain the prize for themes in his college,
and came out second instead of first, as was expected,
at the examination.</p>

<p>He now returned to his native place for a short
time, for much-needed rest and change; not, however,
staying much at Truro, but passing most of his
holiday at Woodbury, just below Malpas, on the
Fal, the residence of his brother-in-law, Rev. Mr.
Curgenven (curate of the parishes of Kenwyn and
Kea). These were amongst the happiest moments
of his life. He says, either of this place or Lamorran
(and the description is applicable to either):
'The scene is such as is frequently to be met with
in this part of Cornwall. Below the house is an
arm of the sea flowing between the hills, which are
covered with wood. By the shore I walk in general,
in the evening, out of the reach of all sound but the
rippling of the water and the whistling of the curlew.'</p>

<p>On his return to Cambridge in the following
October, conversations with Mr. Simeon, instigated
by a perusal of the 'Life and Labours of David
Brainerd among the North American Indians,' gave
rise to Martyn's intense desire to become a missionary;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and, notwithstanding his alleged appreciative
enjoyment of a literary and social life at home,
he offered his services to a Missionary Society.
They were not, however, accepted; and after having
been ordained at Ely in October, 1803, he became
Mr. Simeon's curate&mdash;preaching sometimes at Lolworth,
a church six miles from the University, on the
Huntingdon road, and sometimes at Trinity Church,
Cambridge. Simeon always continued a friend and
admirer of Martyn, and had his portrait hung up
over his fireplace. He often used to look up at it
with affectionate earnestness: 'There!' he used to
say, 'see that blessed man! What an expression of
countenance! No one looks at me as he does&mdash;he
seems always to be saying, "Be serious, be in
earnest; don't trifle&mdash;<em>don't</em> trifle." 'Then he would
smile at the picture, and gently bow, and add: 'And
I won't trifle&mdash;I won't trifle.'</p>

<p>Early in 1804, Martyn, as well as his younger
sister, Sally (Mrs. Pearson), to whom he seems to
have been fondly attached, had the misfortune to
lose all their patrimony; an event which, in addition
to the causes already referred to, probably led to
his making a second effort (which was also at the
time unsuccessful) to procure an appointment as
a missionary&mdash;this time in the form of a 'chaplaincy'
to the East India Company. This year was
further memorable from Martyn's making the acquaintance
of a kindred spirit&mdash;the poet, H. Kirke
White (also a Johnian), 'a religious young man of
seventeen, who wants to come to college, but has
only ¬£20 a year.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Another visit to his solitary retreat in Cornwall
refreshed him during the summer, and whilst there
he preached to a crowded congregation at Kenwyn
Church from 2 Cor. v. 20, 21: 'Now we are ambassadors,'
etc. (a very favourite text of his), and
availed himself of the opportunity, before returning
to Cambridge on 18th of September, 1804, to take
leave of his county and friends, in view of the
probability of his soon getting the desired appointment
under the East India Company. On his way
back to the University, as his journals testify, with
characteristic zeal and devotedness, though, apparently,
not always with tact and skill, he lost no
opportunity, in season or out of season, of turning
the conversation of his fellow-travellers to religious
topics.</p>

<p>At this period of his life his usual routine seems to
have been to rise every morning at about half-past
five (and, if he failed to do so, his self-reproaches are
most bitter); to work hard, either with his pupils, his
flock, or his books; to pray at least four times a day,
and to write at least one sermon a week. The
Scriptures he doubtless read daily; and the spirit
in which he read them may be seen from the following
extract from his Journals, written when on
board ship, on his way to India: 'Read Isaiah
the rest of the evening&mdash;sometimes happy and
at other times tired, and desiring to take up
some other religious book; <em>but I saw it an important
duty to check this slighting of the Word of God</em>.'
And here it may be interesting to note the other
works which seem to have been amongst Martyn's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
favourites. Of course, he kept up his mathematics
and science; but the references to these in his
Journals are slight and few. He often read the
Greek plays, but his chief reading was, as might
be expected, divinity; and especially St. Augustine,
Grotius, Paley, Baxter, Hooker, Pearson,
Fletcher's 'Portrait,' Flavel's 'Saint Indeed,' Searle's
'Christian Remembrancer,' Thomas √† Kempis,
Law's 'Serious Call,' Lowth, Bishop Hopkins,
Jonathan Edwards's 'Original Sin,' and his work on
the Affections, Whitfield's Journal, Leighton, Milner's
'Church History,' etc., etc.; and these were
interspersed with the study of Hindostanee and
other Oriental languages.</p>

<p>Martyn's religious position and views have been
thus described in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> for July,
1844, by a writer who traces their origin to the
well-known Clapham School of 'Evangelical' religion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'From that circle he adopted, in all its unadorned
simplicity, the system called Evangelical&mdash;that system
of which (if Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Knox, and
the writers of the English Homilies may be credited)
Christ Himself was the author, and Paul the first
and greatest interpreter.</p>

<p>'Through shallow heads and voluble tongues, such
a creed (or indeed any creed) filtrates so easily, that,
of the multitudes who maintain it, comparatively
few are aware of the conflict of their faith with the
natural and unaided reason of mankind. Indeed, he
who makes such an avowal will hardly escape the
charge of affectation or of impiety. Yet if any truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
be clearly revealed, it is, that the Apostolic doctrine
was foolishness to the sages of this world. If any
unrevealed truth be indisputable, it is, that such
sages are at this day making, as they have ever
made, ill-disguised efforts to escape the inferences
with which their own admissions teem. Divine
philosophy divorced from human science&mdash;celestial
things stripped of the mitigating veils woven by
man's wit and fancy to relieve them&mdash;form an abyss
as impassable at Oxford now, as at Athens eighteen
centuries ago. To Henry Martyn the gulf was visible,
the self-renunciation painful, the victory complete.
His understanding embraced, and his heart reposed
in, the two comprehensive and ever-germinating
tenets of the school in which he studied. Regarding
his own heart as corrupt, and his own reason as
delusive, he exercised an unlimited affiance in the
holiness and the wisdom of Him, in whose person
the divine nature had been allied to the human, that,
in the persons of his followers, the human might be
allied to the divine.</p>

<p>'Such was his religious theory&mdash;a theory which
doctors may combat, or admit, or qualify, but in
which the readers of Henry Martyn's Biography,
Letters, and Journals, cannot but acknowledge that
he found the resting-place of all the impetuous appetencies
of his mind, the spring of all his strange
powers of activity and endurance. Prostrating his
soul before the real, though the hidden Presence he
adored, his doubts were silenced, his anxieties
soothed, and every meaner passion hushed into
repose.'</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>On the 2nd of April, 1805, having previously been
ordained priest at St. James's Chapel Royal, London,
and having taken his degree as Bachelor of Divinity,
he preached his last sermon at Cambridge, and
came to London to prosecute his studies in Hindostanee,
and to preach occasionally at St. John's
Chapel, Bedford Row. It was about this time that
he made the acquaintance of Wilberforce, dining
with him and going afterwards to the House of
Commons, where he was much struck with the
eloquence, great seriousness, and energy of Pitt
'about that which is of no consequence at all.'</p>

<p>He at length, on the 24th April, 1805, obtained
the long-wished-for chaplaincy, with a salary of
¬£1,200 a year, and was fervently longing to enter
upon his labours, exclaiming on one occasion,
from the very depths of his soul: 'Gladly shall this
base blood be shed, every drop of it, if India can be
benefited in one of her children!'</p>

<p>This would seem to be the proper occasion to
advert to a passage in Martyn's Life which must
possess for any genial reader a most touching
interest. The enthusiastic clergyman had become
deeply smitten with the attractions of Miss Lydia
Grenfell, of the parish of St. Hilary, three or four
miles from Marazion. His affection for this lady
appears to have been both profound and sincere;
but he feared that its indulgence might prove a bar
to the higher aims which he had set before him.
His mental conflicts on this subject, as on all others,
were most severe; and under such circumstances,
and with his gloomy and excitable religious views,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
he may have appeared, what the lady herself (some
few years his senior) undoubtedly was, a somewhat
languid and vacillating lover. That the lady never
married him&mdash;although her final refusal did not
reach him till 1807, when he was in India&mdash;was
perhaps fortunate for both parties; but, undoubtedly,
Martyn continued to love her and to correspond
with her to the last. The peculiar circumstances
of this attachment gave rise to Holme Lee's (Harriet
Parr's) story of 'Her Title of Honour;' that title
consisting of the honour done to Eleanor Trevelyan
by being beloved by so good and great a man as
Francis Gwynne (Martyn). Miss Grenfell never
married. Her sister Emma became the wife of the
Rev. T. M. Hitchins,<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> of Devonport, Martyn's
cousin; and some interesting letters to her from
Martyn, mostly bearing upon the subject of his love
for Lydia, will be found in a supplement to the
'Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall' edited
by Mr. Henry Martyn Jeffery, F.R.S. (vol. vii. pt. 3,
December, 1882, No. 26).</p>

<p>The ship in which he was to sail for India left
London on the 8th of July, 1805. Martyn joined
her at Portsmouth on the 17th, after having had
'a convulsion fit' on the road down. The <i>Union</i>
called (unexpectedly) at Falmouth, where she was
detained for three weeks by unfavourable winds, and
Martyn thus had opportunities of returning to St.
Hilary, about twenty miles off, and again enduring
the 'pleasing pain' which he found in his loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
one's society. But whilst there the wind suddenly
shifted, and Martyn had the narrowest possible
escape from missing the ship. His self-reproaches on
such an occasion as this may be imagined!</p>

<p>On the 10th of September the <i>Union</i> at length
sailed from Falmouth, and our devoted hero's dejection
on contemplating the Cornish cliffs fading
away in the distance was very deep. He longed to
die, so he says, on the way out. A storm arose as
they left Ireland behind them, and added to his
sufferings. But at length, after touching at Madeira,
and at San Salvador in Brazil, they safely reached
Calcutta on the 14th of May, 1806, after a tedious
and dangerous voyage of nine months.</p>

<p>On the passage Martyn's usual zeal, and, it might
be added, want of tact, had ample opportunities of
displaying themselves. Nothing could exceed his
devotion to the men when sick, or whenever the
slightest opportunity presented itself of speaking to
any of them on the subject which was ever uppermost
in his own soul. And his courage was admirably
displayed in landing almost <em>with</em> the troops when
the successful attack was delivered by the British
under Sir David Baird upon the French and Dutch
troops at the Cape of Good Hope in January, 1806.
Nor was he unmindful of the welfare of the cadets on
board, to whom he imparted instruction in a variety
of subjects, with all the force of his powerful
intellect. But his religious ministrations were, for
the most part, unappreciated, owing to the excessively
gloomy tone with which they were pervaded,
and to his tendency to 'scold his congregation,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
a fault of which it may be remembered even
Cowper complained in Mr. Scott, the curate of Olney.
The captain dared not allow him to preach more
than once on Sundays, and all the officers made
a point of standing near the cabin-door, so as to
make good their retreat whenever the sermon became
too miserably painful. 'Mr. Martyn,' they
once said, '<em>must</em> not damn us to-day, or none will
come again.'</p>

<p>After a stay of about four months in Calcutta,
during which, notwithstanding a sharp attack of fever,
he went on with his lingual studies, occasionally
preached to somewhat unsympathetic audiences,
and had opportunities of witnessing Suttee and the
Juggernaut procession, he was, on the 13th September,
at length appointed to Dinapore, and on the 15th
October proceeded up the Ganges to his post, in a
budgerow, passing most of his time in translating
portions of the Scriptures into the native tongues.
He reached Dinapore on 26th November, and met
with but a very cold reception from the Europeans
there, as well as from the natives; and, worst of all,
there was no church or church furniture at his
disposal. But he soon got to work, and gave his
most special attention to the native children, who
appeared to have been very apt and tractable, and
for whom he is said to have built, at his own cost,
whilst in India, five schools. He now obtained, for
the purposes of his translations, the assistance (such
as it was) of two natives&mdash;Mirza Fitrut, who is
described as being guileful and hypocritical, and the
vain and furious-tempered Nathanael Sabat, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
seem to have entertained a very cordial jealousy and
hatred of each other. Sabat had served both in the
Turkish and Persian armies. He had a free and
haughty manner, and a fierce look, and signed himself
'Nathanael Sabat, an Arab who was never in
bondage.' He used to contend with Martyn so
violently at times that Martyn had to order his palanquin
and be off to his friends, the Sherwoods.</p>

<p>Part of the Prayer Book was, under conditions
such as these, translated into Hindostanee; to this
his 'dear friend and brother chaplain' Corrie added;
but it was not completed until 1829, seventeen years
after Martyn's death. In 1807 Martyn finished,
in Hindostanee, his 'Commentary on the Parables;'
and, by the end of 1809, a plain and idiomatic
version of the four Gospels. The following year
saw the New Testament completed. His translations
into the Persian were not considered quite
so successful; but about this time he appears to
have first definitely conceived the desire of evangelizing
Persia, and it was always with regret that
he went on with his translations, dreading lest they
might interfere with his strictly ministerial duties.
He was at this time so strict a Sabbatarian that he
thought he was doing wrong in translating even the
Prayer Book into Hindostanee on a Sunday.</p>

<p>Signs of breaking health were now becoming too
painfully apparent; in fact, he may be said to have
been constantly ill. His friend Corrie (afterwards
Bishop of Madras) paid Martyn two visits in 1808,
and saw that 'there was small prospect of his long
continuance in this vale of tears.' But the tone of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Martyn's people towards him had somewhat improved;
and in April, 1809, he was moved to Cawnpore,
a distance of 240 miles&mdash;the journey being performed
in a fierce heat. He was kindly received by
Captain and Mrs. Sherwood; but here again he
found no church. He first preached at Cawnpore in
the native tongue, and remained at his post until the
30th September, 1810, when, notwithstanding his
'bright invincibility of spirit,' his health utterly
gave way, and he went back to Calcutta, arriving
there with pallid countenance and enfeebled frame.
'Fortia agere Romanum est, fortia pati Christianum,'
wrote an old author; and, surely, if ever the
courage of the Roman, and the calm brave endurance
of the Christian met, they met in Henry
Martyn.</p>

<p>But returning after a while to Cawnpore, he
resumed his correspondence with Miss Grenfell,
now <em>as a friend</em>; and tells her that this was his
daily routine: 'We rise at daybreak, and breakfast
at six. Immediately after breakfast we pray<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
together; after which I translate into Arabic with
Sabat, who lives in a small bungalow on my ground.
We dine at twelve, and sit recreating ourselves with
talking about dear friends in England. In the afternoon
I translate with Mirza Fitrut into Hindostanee;
and Corrie employs himself in teaching some
native Christian boys, whom he is educating with
great care, in the hopes of their being fit for the
office of catechists. I have also a school on my premises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
for natives; but it is not well attended. At
sunset we ride or drive, and then meet at the
church, where we often raise the song of praise with
as much joy, through the grace and presence of our
Lord, as you do in England. At ten we are all
asleep.... My work at present is evidently to
translate; hereafter I may itinerate.'</p>

<p>By the spring of 1810 his church, converted from
its former use as a heathen temple, was ready,<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and
his friend Corrie came to visit and assist him; but
he preached in it for the last time on 30th September,
1810, and shortly afterwards went back to
Calcutta.</p>

<p>Persia now finally became the object of Martyn's
pious yearnings; and, on the 9th January, in the
following year, he set out on his memorable, but, it
is much to be feared, slightly rewarded, journey&mdash;a
journey accomplished with so much fatigue, and
under such sudden and excessive changes of temperature,
as to have been, doubtless, the proximate
cause of the destruction of his frail body. He
stopped at Goa on the route, and travelled <em>vi√¢</em>
Bombay, landing at Muscat, in Arabia Felix, on the
22nd April. On the 30th he set out for Shiraz, 'the
City of the Rose'&mdash;the Athens of Persia, where he
arrived on the 9th June, and met with a most insulting
reception from the people. But Martyn thought
that even such a reception as this was better than so
unworthy a sinner as he merited! Referring to this
episode in Martyn's career Dean Alford writes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The pale-faced Frank among them sits: what brought him from afar?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor bears he bales of merchandise, nor teaches arts of war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One pearl alone he brings with him&mdash;the Book of life and death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One warfare only teaches he&mdash;to fight the fight of faith.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">Matters, however, improved after a while; the
Armenian ladies came to kiss his hand, and the
priest incensed him four times over at the altar.
Here, on the 24th February, 1812, he completed,
under most discouraging circumstances, his translation
of the New Testament into Persian.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> After
labouring 'for six weary moons,' a similar version of
the Psalms was finished in the following month; and on
the 24th May, 'the meek missionary of the Cross'
left Shiraz in order to present the precious documents
himself to the Shah. Much difficulty and
delay intervened on account of the diplomatic formalities
considered necessary on such an occasion;
and eventually, after visiting Ispahan and Teheran,
Martyn was disappointed in the object he had in
view, having been struck down by illness, increased
by the hardships of travel and climate, before his
desires were accomplished. For two months he was
completely laid up&mdash;weeping many 'tears from the
depths of a divine despair'&mdash;at the house of Sir Gore
Ouseley, the British Ambassador at Tabriz, who
afterwards had the gratification of showing Martyn's
manuscript to the Shah, and it was sent to St.
Petersburg to be printed.</p>

<p>This renewed illness caused Martyn to determine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
on returning to England, for his health's sake. But
it was too late. On his homeward way (<em>vi√¢</em> Constantinople),
seeing Mount Ararat on the journey,
and passing through Erivan, Kars, Erzeroum, and
Tokat&mdash;'hardly knowing how to keep his life in
him'&mdash;he succumbed near the latter place, to hunger,
thirst, sunstroke, fever and ague, aggravated by his
desperate gallop for life across the scorching plains,
and beneath a rainless sky, untempered by a
single cloud, on the 6th October, 1812, in the thirty-second
year of his age. Here the last entry, commencing
'Oh! when shall Time give place to
Eternity?' appears in his sad, self-searching diary.
Ten days afterwards he was no more.</p>

<p>He was buried in the Armenian burial-ground
at Tokat, with the honours usually accorded by
Armenian Christians to an Archbishop; and a
marble slab, which the Tokat Christians were wont to
keep clear of weeds, covers his remains. Sir R. K.
Porter, in his 'Travels in Persia' (vol. ii., p. 703),
after eulogizing Martyn's self-devotion and zeal
beyond the strength of a naturally delicate constitution,
adds that 'exhausted nature sank under the
apostolic labour, and in this place he was called to
the rest of heaven. His remains sleep in a grave as
humble as his own meekness.'</p>

<p>Would it be too much to say of him</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Heaven scarce believed the conquest it surveyed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Saints with wonder heard the vows he made'?<br /></span>

</div>

<p class="noind">Wordsworth's lines, at least, on another devoted
son of the Church, are clearly appropriate to
Martyn:</p>

</div></div>

<p>His tomb is still, I believe, piously regarded by the
natives, and it has been adorned by Lord Macaulay
with the following lines:</p>

<p>A Hall, dedicated to his memory, and designed to
provide a place of meeting for the different Religious
Societies in Cambridge, is about to be erected in
Market Street; and on the centenary of Martyn's
birth, viz., 18th February, 1881, special services
in his memory were held at the pro-Cathedral at
Truro. In the evening Bishop Benson delivered a
lecture on Martyn at the Town Hall, at the close of
which he proposed that subscriptions should be invited
towards the construction of a portion of the
new Cathedral, as for instance an aisle or transept,
to be dedicated to the cause of Missions in honour
of his name. A Baptistry was finally decided upon;
and about ¬£1,250 had been collected up to June, 1883.
By the attainment of these objects, this distinguished
Cornishman, whose motto was, 'To believe, to
suffer, and to love,' will be provided with fitting
memorials.</p>

pale; his hair, a light brown, was raised from his forehead, which was
a remarkably fine one. His features were not regular, but the expression
was so luminous, so intellectual, so affectionate, so beaming with
divine charity, as to absorb the attention of every observer; there was
a very decided air of the gentleman, too, about Mr. Martyn, and a
perfection of manners arising from his extreme attention to all minute
civilities. He had, moreover, a rich, deep voice and a fine taste for
vocal music.'</p></div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>near the hamlet of Mithian, in the out-of-the-way
parish of St. Agnes. The bleak desolate moors,
saturated by frequent hissing rain-storms, and
scarred with mine-heaps, the jagged cliff-coast, and
the dark rolling Atlantic waves of the neighbouring
sea, have a savage grandeur of their own which cannot
have been without its effect on the youthful
mind of the future professor of painting. For,
though he rose to the high position of a Royal
Academician when only about twenty-seven years of
age, we shall seek, I think, in vain amongst his works
for that delicate, airy grace of many of his more
courtly contemporaries, which no one admired more
than himself; and we shall find instead an original,
broad, and manly, though somewhat grim and sombre
style, which may well have been inspired by the wildness
and gloom of his surroundings when a child on
this remote 'bench of the world-school.' Allan Cunningham
says well of him that he was not 'the servile
<em>follower</em> of any man, or of any school;' and, as a
matter of fact, his self-reliance early showed itself.
On seeing a butterfly painted by one Mark Oates, an
officer of Marines, an amateur artist of some merit
(whose portrait Opie afterwards painted),&mdash;Jan Oppie
(as his name was sometimes pronounced) exclaimed:
'<em>I</em> can paint it as well as Mark Oates.'</p>

<p>Opie's father, Edward Opie, who died while John
was quite young, and his grandfather were both of
them carpenters and builders, though a writer in the
<cite>Fine Arts Magazine</cite> has striven to show that the
family was really of old and gentle descent. <em>Tonkin</em>
(who, as a St. Agnes man, ought to have known)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
says the Opies came from Ennis, or De Insula, in St.
Erme.</p>

<p class="small">Arms: Sa. on a chev. between three garbs or, as many hurtleberries
proper.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="noind">Other authorities also say the Opies originally came
from St. Breock. One thing, at least, from the
genealogical point of view, is clear: namely, that the
genius for painting still remains in the family of
Opie: for 'the great nephew of a great uncle'&mdash;as
Mr. Edward Opie is pleasantly called in the recently
published memoirs of Caroline Fox&mdash;has for many
years past been a highly successful portrait and
genre-painter in the West-country, and a constant
exhibitor at the Royal Academy for more than a
quarter of a century.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the origin of the family,
John's father was considered an unusually skilful
craftsman; and his son was apprenticed to him.
His mother, a woman of very high principle and
singularly sweet disposition, was forty-eight when
the son of her old age was born; and she lived till
she was ninety-two, dying in May, 1805. Her maiden
name was Mary Tonkin, of Trevaunance, near St.
Agnes Porth; a family whom Polwhele classes
amongst his 'little gentry' of Cornwall. While on
this point, it may be well to state that Oppy, a
Cornish artist with whom the subject of this memoir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
has frequently been confused, was a member of
another and quite distinct family.</p>

<p>The fire of genius having been kindled by the
butterfly episode, was soon fanned into a flame by the
intense and daring spirit of the boy. Going with his
father to carry out some repairs to the house of Mr.
B. Nankivell, at Mithian, the boy discovered that
in one of the rooms hung a painting of a farmplace.
What its merits were it would be difficult now
to say, for the accounts of it are conflicting; but the
picture excited the most ardent admiration of young
Opie, and he made more than one furtive visit to
the room in order to gaze upon the object of his
emulation, of which he was endeavouring to make a
copy from memory, as he feared to ask permission
to inspect. Being detected, however, on one of
these occasions, the boon of a loan of the picture was
granted, in order that it might serve him as a model.
His delight knew no bounds; the much-wished-for
copy was made, and was sold to a Mrs. Walker<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
(whose son was Vicar of St. Winnow, on the banks
of the Fowey) for five shillings&mdash;a sum the magnitude
of which so astonished the youngster that he
ran about the house shouting: 'I'm set up for life!
I'm set up for life!' Upon this his father is said to
have cynically observed: 'That boy'll come to hanging,
as sure as a gun;'&mdash;in fact, the father did all in
his power to keep the son close to a handicraft which
for two generations had been a sure, if small, means
of support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
John's temperament seems to have always been
excitable. Another instance of his exuberant joy
at an early success was when he returned with
twenty or thirty guineas in his pocket (which he
presented to his mother) from painting some of the
Prideaux portraits, still preserved at Place House,
near Padstow; he threw the glittering coins on the
floor, and himself upon them, twisting about in his
fine new coat, lace ruffles, and silk stockings, and
exclaiming with humorous glee, 'See! see! I'm
walving [wallowing] in gold!' But he was as easily
depressed. He used to tell how he once went to
the neighbouring town of Redruth, with half-a-crown
in his pocket, to buy himself some colours,
but was so attracted by the gilded gingerbreads and
other delights of the fair that in a very short time
his money was all wasted, and he had to trudge
his weary way homewards without the painting
materials, and so overcome by the miserable plight
to which his thoughtlessness had reduced him that
he said he seriously meditated suicide by the way.</p>

<p>There was nothing enervating in the way in which
young Opie was reared. Not only was his fare frugal
and his clothing and lodging of very simple sort, but
his religion and morals were doubtless very strictly
looked after by his parents, who seem to have been of
the old Puritanical school. But the spirit of the
artist broke out one summer Sunday afternoon,
when Opie&mdash;then eleven years old&mdash;was left in the
cottage with his father, whilst old Mrs. Opie went to
church, or meeting-house. The old man had fallen
fast asleep, and his hopeful offspring seized the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
golden opportunity of painting his portrait, hitherto
a forbidden operation;&mdash;the way in which the
'Sabbath-breaking' young rogue was reviled by his
progenitors may be imagined better than I can describe
it. Yet the likeness was so good, and the motive
so affectionate, that the offence was condoned, and
the portrait exhibited to all the neighbours with
parental pride, notwithstanding the boy's having
irritated his father during the progress of the work
by awakening him from his nap in order to 'get his
eyes lightened up.' One of his uncles, however, is
said to have fostered John's talents, both as a
mathematician and as an artist; at any rate his love
of art was not to be quenched, and the cottage-walls
were ere long decorated with portraits of most of his
relations and playfellows, painted with singular force
and brilliancy for so young and untaught an artist.
Wolcot says that Opie used often to get up at three
in the morning to go to work on his painting.</p>

<p>From his thraldom in Mithian, Jan Opie was no
doubt glad to get the chance of escaping, when it was
offered to him by Dr. Wolcot ('Peter Pindar'), then
living at Truro; a man who added to a strong satiric
vein of poetry a considerable amount of artistic
taste, sufficient at any rate to recognise that his
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prot√©g√©</i> was no common lad. It has been said that
Wolcot employed 'Jan' in some menial capacity
about his house on the Green; but this is not the
case. He certainly did give Opie the opportunity of
copying his pictures, some of which were very good;
adding the sound advice to study hard from the life.
It was perhaps also whilst under the old doctor's roof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
that he continued his mathematical studies with
such success that he is said to have mastered his
Euclid when only twelve years old. William Sandby,
in his 'History of the Royal Academy,' says that
Opie had a very good knowledge of Euclid when
only ten years of age; and that, about this time,
spending his scanty pocket-money in candles and
writing materials, he set up an evening school at St.
Agnes, in which most of his pupils were twice as old
as himself. His uncle loved to call him 'little Sir
Isaac.'</p>

<p>Dr. Wolcot did his best to get the rising young
artist commissions from his patients and acquaintances,
and Opie's services were soon in great request
as a local portrait-painter. Many an old Cornish house
still possesses specimens of his early skill, as may be
seen from the long and elaborate account of his works
prepared by the late Mr. J. Jope Rogers. Sir Rose
Price, of Trengwainton, had a portrait of an old
beggar by Opie, which was considered at the time a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i>; and the Truro families of Daniell and
Vivian, who were liberal patrons of his skill, also had
some of the best examples of his rapid, vigorous
brush. Viscount Bateman, who was for some time
quartered at Pendennis Castle, Falmouth, with his
regiment, the Hereford Militia, was another of his
early patrons, and gave Opie several commissions to
paint beggars, old men, and similar subjects. His
usual price for a portrait, when he was sixteen years
of age, was seven shillings and sixpence.</p>

<p>But John Opie was getting a little too big for his
remote native county; and, instigated by 'Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Pindar,' resolved on trying his fortunes in London.
The story goes&mdash;and it is not without some sort
of foundation&mdash;that the doctor (who had met with
some pecuniary losses) and his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prot√©g√©</i> (or <em>pupil</em>, as
Wolcot preferred calling him) were to share profits;
but that this arrangement only lasted for a year. However
that may be, either in 1780 or 1781 they both
came to Town, when 'the Cornish wonder' was
forthwith introduced to Sir Joshua Reynolds, then
President of the Royal Academy; and in 1782, Opie,
now twenty-one years of age, exhibited (for the first
time) on the walls of that institution pictures of an
old man's head, an old woman, and three portraits.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>He now, with Wolcot, took apartments, which he
himself furnished out of the thirty or forty guineas
which formed his capital, in Orange Court, Leicester
Fields&mdash;near Sir Joshua Reynolds' studio. The
court itself is demolished, but it stood at the back
of the present National Gallery, on the site of St.
George's Barracks. Here John soon got to work
with his painting&mdash;copying the old masters, and studying
diligently the best English authors, whose wit
and wisdom his powerful mind and retentive memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
enabled him to easily assimilate and retain. Milton,
Shakespeare, Dryden, Pope, Gray, Cowper, Butler
(Hudibras), Burke, and Dr. Johnson seem to have
been his special favourites. The last-named he
idolized, and painted his portrait twice. He now
also added French, Italian, and a little Latin to his
attainments. Sitters gradually thronged round him;
he 'trembled at his terrific popularity' and his many
flatterers; and, having been introduced to the King
and Queen, his fame spread like wild-fire, and he
used merrily to say that he thought of keeping a
loaded cannon at his door to frighten off the crowds
by whom he was besieged. Wolcot says that Jan
answered 'George' with St. Agnes intrepidity, that
the King bought some of his pictures, and wished
Opie every success.</p>

<p>The following is a letter to his mother on the
memorable occasion of his reception at the Palace.
The MS., much tattered and torn, was communicated
to the Rev. Richard Polwhele by the present Mr.
Edward Opie:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'<span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I received my brother's two last letters, and
am exceedingly sorry to hear that my father is so
poorly; don't let him work any more, I hope he will
be better before this arrives. I have all the prospect
of success that is possible, having much more business
than I can possibly do. I have been with the
King and Queen, who were highly pleased with my
work, and took two of my pictures, and they are
hung up in the King's collection at the Queen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
palace. As to the ¬£200 business, it is entirely false,
for I was but paid my price and no more. I could
have had more money for the pictures if I had sold
them to several noblemen.... There is no work
stirring at this time, and it is a very improper time
to see the town, as it is cold and very dirty, and so
full of smoak and fog that you can hardly see the
length of your nose, and I should not be able to stir
anywhere out by day nor keep them company indoors,
by reason of the quantity of business. I
would advise them to come up in June, when they
may see everything in fine weather, and probably I
shall not be so busy then as I am now, because most
of the quality go out of town at that time, and then
also they may see all the great houses, &amp;c., but now
the familys are in town, they'd not be able to see
one. As to my stay here, it will depend on circumstances,
as the continuation of employ and the
encouragement I may meet with. If I have time
and money I shall certainly come down in the
summer.... Many have been in town, years, and
have had nothing to do, whilst I, who have been
here but two or three months, am known and talked
of by everybody. To be known, is the great thing
in London. A man may do ever so well, if nobody
knows it, it will signify nothing; and among so many
thousand and ten thousand people, it is no easy
matter to get known. I cannot think what gave
rise to the report which you heard, as I have never
had a present from anybody in my life. Money is
very scarce among everybody, and I only desire to
get paid for what I do. I have a new method, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
make them all, or most of them, pay half as soon as
I begin the pictures, which is a very good method.
Brother E. and his wife are very well and will be
very glad to see Brother and Betty up at the time I
mentioned; they join in their duty to you and Father,
and love to Uncle, Brother and sisters, &amp;c., with
your affectionate son,</p>

<p class="right">'<span class="smcap">J. Opie</span>. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p class="small">'March 11, 1782.'</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>In the following year he removed to Great Queen
Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields; and somewhere about
this time became infatuated with the black eyes and
arch smiles of a City solicitor's daughter, one Mary
Bunn, of St. Botolph's, Aldgate, who brought him
some money on his marriage with her at St. Martin's-in-the-Fields,
4th December, 1782. It was a foolish
union&mdash;she, pretty and giddy, and her husband a
blunt, strong-minded, hard-working artist. He tried
to gloss over her follies, being placable to a degree;
but in vain. She at last crowned her faithless
career by eloping with a Mr. John Edwards in 1795,
and an Act of divorce left Opie a free and a happier
man. It was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">√† propos</i> of this miserable affair that
Opie once uttered the following grim <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon-mot</i>. He
was passing the above-named church one day
with his quondam friend Godwin, who was an infidel,
when Godwin exclaimed: 'Ah! I was christened at
that church.' 'And I was married in it,' replied
Opie; 'they make unsure work there, for it neither
holds in wedlock nor in baptism.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>But at length the crowds of sitters and callers
who used to annoy both Opie and his neighbours
began to dwindle away, as the novelty of seeing that
'nine days' wonder'&mdash;a great artist&mdash;in</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">began to wear off; and gave Opie the much-desired
opportunity of pursuing the higher branches of his
art. Henceforth he painted less portraits and more
historical compositions; but amongst the former, even
up to the end of his career, we still find some notable
subjects, such as a whole-length of Charles James
Fox (which West thought his best), William Siddons
(the husband of the great actress), Fuseli, Southey,
the Poet Laureate,<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and many others. In 1784 he
exhibited his 'School,' of which Horace Walpole
remarked that it was 'Great nature&mdash;the best of his
works yet.'</p>

<p>His first great work of the 'historical' school,
and one of his very best, 'The Assassination of James
I. of Scotland,' was produced in 1786; as to which a
writer in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> for 1866 tells the following
amusing story of Northcote's jealousy of Opie.
When the latter was engaged at Hampstead on this
picture (the story is, by the way, also told of the
Rizzio picture), Northcote became alarmed at the
reports which reached him of its extraordinary merit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
and accordingly he paid a visit to Opie's studio in
order to judge for himself. 'When I entered the
room,' he said, 'I was astounded. The picture had
the finest effect I ever witnessed; the light on the
figures gleamed up from a trap-door by which the
murderers were entering the King's chamber. "Oh!"
said I to myself; "go home, go home; it is all over
with you!" I did go home, and brooded over what
I had seen. I could think of nothing else; it
perfectly haunted me. I could not work on my own
pictures for thinking of his. At last, unable to bear
it any longer, I determined to go there again, and
when I entered the room I saw, to my great comfort,
that Opie had rubbed all the fine effect out.'</p>

<p>In the following year his next great work, 'The
Assassination of David Rizzio,'<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> was painted, and
Opie's claim to be elected an Associate of the Royal
Academy was established, the full honours being
accorded to him the year after. His diploma picture,
'Age and Infancy,' still hangs on the Academy's walls.</p>

<p>Amongst his other more important works may be
named, 'The Presentation in the Temple,' 'Jephthah's
Vow,' 'Young Arthur taken Prisoner,' 'Arthur
with Hubert,' 'Belisarius,' 'Juliet in the Garden,'
'The Escape of Gil Blas' (his last historical work),
and 'Musidora.' A very large proportion of these,
and others of Opie's paintings have been engraved.
It may be here mentioned, as an illustration of the
prices which some of Opie's best works fetch, that
at the sale of Mr. Jesse Watts Russell's pictures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
at Christie and Manson's, in July, 1875, 'The Schoolmistress,'
from the collection of Mr. Watson Taylor,
a large and important work of several figures&mdash;an old
lady schoolmistress and her pupils&mdash;painted in
emulation of Rembrandt, fetched ¬£787 10s.</p>

<p>Pursuing his career at the Royal Academy, in 1789,
on the expulsion of Barry, the Professor of Painting,
on account of his impertinent remarks upon his brother
Academicians, and his generally unsatisfactory conduct,
Opie preferred his claims; but was induced to
waive them in favour of the elder artist, Fuseli.
The latter, however, resigned in 1805, and the indisputable
claims of Opie to the post were at once
fully and honourably recognised.</p>

<p>Before, however, that event took place, one which
had still greater and happier influence on our
artist's professional career and domestic happiness
occurred: in 1798 he had the good fortune to fall in
love at first sight, and, after much coy reluctance
on the lady's part, to secure the heart and hand of
the amiable, sprightly, and accomplished Amelia
Alderson, the only child of a Norwich physician,
and a relative of H. P. Briggs, R.A. They were
married on the 8th of May ('Flora Day,' as it is
called in Cornwall), she being then twenty-nine years
of age, and her husband thirty-seven. She was
much courted in the fashionable circles of London
for her literary and conversational talents, and
numbered Sir Walter Scott, Sir James Mackintosh,
Wordsworth and Sydney Smith among her friends
and acquaintances.</p>

<p>When she became a Quakeress (and I fancy that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
at heart she was always more or less of one) in
1825, she endeavoured to recall her novels; but
copies of them are still to be met with in many of our
libraries. Indeed, she tells us that she would never
have published at all had it not been for the strong
wish of her husband that she should do so.</p>

<p>As regards her novels, or tales, as they should
rather be called, 'She can do nothing well,' says
Jeffrey, 'that requires to be done with formality, and
therefore has not succeeded in copying either the
concentrated force of weighty and deliberate reason,
or the severe and solemn dignity of majestic virtue.
To make amends, however, she represents admirably
everything that is amiable, generous and gentle.'</p>

<p>Of her poetic vein, the following specimen may
perhaps be admitted here:&mdash;</p>

<p class="negidt2 med90">LINES WRITTEN IN 1799, BY MRS. OPIE TO HER

</div>

<p>She died on the 2nd December, 1853, eighty-four
years of age (forty-seven years after her husband's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
death), and was buried in the same grave with her
father, in the Friends' burial-ground, at the Gilden
Croft, Norwich. Her life has been written by her
friend, Miss Brightwell; and a portrait of 'la charmante
Madame Opie' (as she was called in Paris),
in her Quakeress's cap and with uplifted eyes full of
gentle ardour, after a medallion by David, is prefixed
to that work. Haydon also (who, by the way,
was indebted to Opie for much sound practical advice
in his art) painted her, in her tall black Quakeress's
bonnet, in his great group of the 'Anti-Slavery Convention,'
now in the National Portrait Gallery; and
her husband painted her portrait more than once: an
engraving after one of these portraits is prefixed to
a later edition of Miss Brightwell's 'Life.'</p>

<p>To her more refined taste were said to be due not
only a superior delicacy and grace sometimes
thought to be found in the female portraits painted
after Opie's second marriage, but also some of the
finer touches in his lectures as Professor of Painting,
to which reference will presently be made. But Mrs.
Opie disclaimed the latter suggestion with all the
energy and indignation of which her tranquil spirit
was capable, observing that 'the slight texture of
muslin could as easily assume the consistency of
velvet.' About half of Opie's sitters were ladies; and
one of his best early works is a portrait of Mrs.
Delany,<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> now at Hampton Court; it used formerly
to hang in the Royal bedchamber at Windsor. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
following contemporary criticism by a Cornish lady
on Opie's work will be interesting to at least some of
my readers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p><em>The Hon<sup>ble</sup>. Mrs. Boscawen to Mrs. Delany.</em></p>
<p class="right small">'26th Sept., 1782.</p>

<p class="pyy">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>'Your favoured Opie is still in raptures at the
thoughts of Bulstrode (the residence of the Duke of
Portland). His portrait of Lady Jerningham did
not <em>quite</em> satisfy me, for I concluded it wou'd be
perfect, and her <em>person</em>, <em>hands</em>, <em>posture</em>, <em>spinning-wheel</em>,
all <em>are so</em>; but the face (or rather countenance) does
not <em>quite</em> please me.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>To his wife Opie was indebted for the graceful and
affectionate memoir&mdash;her 'dearest and last duty'&mdash;which
was prefixed to his 'Lectures,' which she edited
after his death, in 1809. It is said that he used
always to keep in his studio an unfinished portrait
of his wife, with her abundant waves of auburn hair,
constantly working on it in order to obtain that
power of delineation of female delicacy and beauty
in which he thought himself deficient. Opie was
devotedly attached to her, and they were most
happy in each other's love; the only point of
difference between them being her liking for a gayer
social existence than suited her husband's tastes.
Yet he was always fond of a dinner-party when
there was <em>good talk</em>, and many such noteworthy
gatherings are described in Holcroft's 'Memoirs.'
They had a memorable trip to Paris together in 1802;
the only occasion on which Opie ever left England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
except once before, in 1786, for a short trip to
the picture-galleries in Belgium and Holland. Mrs.
Opie was very fond of sketching in profile all her
friends' portraits, of which she made a large collection,
and was altogether a lady of refined tastes as
well as of the most active benevolence. Southey
has sketched her in his 'Colloquies,' vol. ii., p. 322;
and her friend and biographer has told us that
'her cheerful heart shone through her bright face,
and brought comfort and pleasure into every house
she entered.' Miss Thackeray (Mrs. Richmond
Ritchie) has also included Amelia Opie in her recent
'Book of Sibyls;' and Harriet Martineau has admirably
described her in the 'Biographical Sketches.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In 1791 Opie had moved to the house in which he
resided for the last sixteen years of his life, No. 8,
Berners Street, Oxford Street;<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and here he passed
what was probably his serenest and happiest days,
overshadowed with only one cloud, and that was one
which scarcely disturbed him, for he attributed it to
causes over which he had no control. I mean his
decreasing popularity, which for a short time waned;
but, as we shall see, was at length recovered. Public
caprice no doubt had, as Opie thought, much to do
with this; but the novelty had gone off, and the
London world is always on the look-out for new
wonders. His pencil was, notwithstanding, as ever,
busy. Alderman Boydell had formed the idea of a
Shakespeare Gallery&mdash;a collection of pictures which
should illustrate the works of our greatest dramatist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Now Shakespeare was, as we have seen, a favourite
author with Opie; and the painter accordingly set
to work with a will, adding five pictures to the
series, to which many other eminent artists also
contributed. Amongst them are the following:</p>

<div class="pfs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="List of Paintings">
<tr><td align="left">Juliet on her Bed</td><td> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td><td align="left">Romeo and Juliet.</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p class="noind">To Macklin's 'British Poets and Bible,' and to
Bowyer's 'Hume's History of England,' he also
contributed largely. 'The Death of Sapphira' is a
remarkable example of his artistic power.</p>

<p>About this period he must have written the following
letter to his sister, which is perhaps worth
inserting&mdash;being, as it were, a peep behind the scenes,
affording us a glimpse of his rough, affectionate nature:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />

</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'What the devil is the reason that thou art
in such a fright, indeed what should make thee
suspect the contrary? My not having written is the
very thing that ought to have kept thee quiet, for if
any accident had happened to me thou certainly
wouldst have heard of it by me and by many others,
henceforth I desire thou wilt remember the old
saying "no news is good news," and not fret thyself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
because I am lazy and don't like to write when I
have nothing to say.</p>

<p>'My dearest Amelia was not so fortunate in
coming to town as myself; she was overturned in the
mail about 30 miles from town, and so bruised as to
cause her to be lame for a fortnight or three weeks
after, but she is now I hope perfectly recovered: she
desires me to give her kindest love to you and

<p>'Let brother's picture be sent off as soon as
possible, and I will take care the other shall be sent
down as soon as I have time to paint one of Amelia

</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>But it is time to speak of his literary talents. Charles
James Fox,<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Horne Tooke, and Sir James Mackintosh
had the highest opinion of his mental powers.
Horne Tooke (whose portrait also Opie painted) says
of him that he spoke in axioms worthy to be remembered;
and Mackintosh observed: 'Had Mr.
Opie turned his powers of mind to the study of philosophy,
he would have been one of the first philosophers
of the age. I was never more struck than with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>his original manner of thinking and expressing himself
in conversation; had he written on the subject
he would probably have thrown more light on the
philosophy of his art than any man living.'</p>

<p>There is a capital short 'Life of Sir Joshua Reynolds'
by Opie, written for Pilkington's 'Dictionary
of Painters;' and the accompanying extract from a
letter which he addressed to one of the periodicals
on the subject of a grand national memorial to the
triumphs of the British fleet, may serve as a specimen
of his powerful, glowing style. Opie proposed a
huge building in which everything connected with
the subject might be displayed&mdash;including statues of
our naval heroes, surrounded by pictorial representations
of their achievements.</p>

<p>'What an effect,' he says, 'might a design like
this, happily planned and executed, produce! How
magnificent, how instructive it might be made!
How entertaining to trace down from the earliest
records of our history the gradual increase of our
navy! to remark the different stages of its growth
from a few simple canoes, in its infancy, to the
stupendous magnitude of a hundred first-rate men-of-war,
miracles of the mechanic arts, proudly bearing
Britain's thunder! the bulwarks of England!
the glory of Englishmen, and the terror and admiration
of the world! How flattering to the
imagination to anticipate the pleasure of walking
round such an edifice, and surveying the different
subjects depicted on its walls! Battles under all
varied circumstances of day, night, moonlight, storm,
and calm!&mdash;the effects of fire, water, wind and smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
mingled in terrific confusion. In the midst, British
Valour triumphantly bearing down all opposition,
accompanied by Humanity, equally daring and ready
to succour the vanquished foe! Discoveries, in which
we see delineated the strange figures and still stranger
costume of nations till then unknown, and where
the face of Nature herself is exhibited under a new
and surprising aspect. Then to turn and behold
the statues and portraits of the enterprising commanders
and leaders in the expeditions recorded,
and compare their different countenances: here a
Drake and an Anson! there a Blake, a Hawke, a
Boscawen, and a Cook!'</p>

<p>To me these enthusiastic sentences have something
of the ring of a sea-song of Dibdin's; and it is
pleasant to think that the idea has been carried out
in the Painted Hall at Greenwich Hospital.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>His Lectures before the Royal Academy (prepared
with a severity of labour which probably shortened
his life), are, however, the works by which his literary
fame will be handed down to posterity. Sandby
tells us that Opie had, shortly before his appointment
to his Professorship, delivered some lectures
on Art at the Royal Institution; but though they
were generally thought good, and were numerously
and fashionably attended (that sour critic, Allan
Cunningham, by the way, calls them 'confused,
abrupt, and unmethodical'), Opie was himself
much dissatisfied with them, and would not
complete the intended course. He was also concerned
in a scheme, in conjunction with West and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Flaxman, for establishing a 'Gallery of Honour,'
under the sanction of the Royal Academy, for the
encouragement and reward of all those who contributed
to the higher walks of art. And he is
further said to have projected a colossal statue of
Britannia, to be erected in some prominent position
in the Isle of Wight, as an alternative mode of
commemorating the naval victories of Great Britain.
Northcote, again (whom, it may be observed, Wolcot,
as Opie's patron, much abused), was associated with
Opie in 'a project of getting paintings into St. Paul's,'
which they hoped 'would tend to raise the drooping
head, or rather the almost expiring art, of painting;'
and to this project the Bishop of London gave his
assent.</p>

<p>Opie's 'Discourses on Painting' were delivered
before the Royal Academy in 1807.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> His scheme included
six: four on the practical aspect of the subject,
viz., 'Design or Drawing,' 'Colouring,' 'Chiaroscuro,'
and 'Composition;' and two on the intellectual side,
viz. 'Invention' and 'Expression.' The last of the
series in each division, viz. those on 'Composition' and
'Expression,' he did not live to complete. I propose to
give as characteristic a short specimen as I can select
from each of the four which Opie delivered,<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> merely
premising that they were enthusiastically received,
and that their author was, for once, satisfied with
his work, and so elated by his success that he could
not sleep. Even Allan Cunningham admitted: 'A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>passage such as this would reflect credit on any
professor the Academy ever possessed.'</p>

<p>In his first lecture, on 'Design or Drawing,' after insisting
on the absolute necessity for hard study of
anatomy, with constant practice so as to insure accurate
drawing, without which, whatever may be the
other merits of the work, 'when the tide of taste
rises, and the winds of criticism bluster and beat
upon it, the showy but ill-founded edifice must
quickly be swept away, or swallowed up and forgotten
for ever,' he goes on to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'These remarks are the more necessary, as it must
be confessed that the strength of the English painters
never lay so much as it ought in <em>design</em>; and now
perhaps, more than ever, they seem devoted to the
charms of colour and effect, and captivate by the
mere penmanship of the art&mdash;the empty legerdemain
of the pencil.</p>

<p>'But if the English artist runs counter in this
instance to the established character of his country,
and prefers the superficial to the solid attainments in
art, has he not many excuses? May it not in great
measure be attributed to the general frivolity and
meanness of the subjects he is called upon to treat?
to the inordinate rage for portrait-painting (a more
respectable kind of caricature), by which he is for
ever condemned to study and copy the wretched
defects, and conform to the still more wretched prejudices,
of every tasteless and ignorant individual,
however in form, features, and mind, utterly hostile
to all ideas of character, expression, or sentiment?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
And may it not in part be attributed to the necessity
he is under of painting always with reference to the
exhibition? In a crowd he that talks loudest, not
he that talks best, is surest of commanding attention;
and in an exhibition he that does not attract
the eye does nothing. But however plausible these
excuses, it becomes the true painter to consider that
they will avail nothing before the tribunal of the
world and posterity. Keeping the true end of Art in
view, he must rise superior to the prejudices, disregard
the applause, and contemn the censure of
corrupt and incompetent judges; far from aiming to
be fashionable, it must be his object to reform, and
not to flatter&mdash;to teach, and not to please&mdash;if he
aspires, like Zeuxis, to paint for eternity.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The spirit of this passage will, I think, enable us
to understand how irksome mere portrait-painting
must always have been to our professor; and its
precepts might be laid to heart even by the artists of
the close of this nineteenth century.</p>

<p>In the lecture on 'Invention' the following passage
seems to me worthy of being reproduced. He
observed that both the poet and the painter have
'something more to do than to illustrate, explain, or
fill the chasms of history or tradition;' they must
both first penetrate thoroughly into the subject, and
then mould it anew.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'Each adopts a chain of circumstances for the most
part inapplicable in the case of the other; each
avails himself of their common privilege of "daring
everything to accomplish his end," not scrupling on
some occasions to run counter, if necessary, even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
matter of fact; for though most strictly bound to
the observance of truth and probability, these
are obviously very different from such as is required
in <em>history</em>; his truth is the truth of <em>effect</em>, and his probability
the perfect <em>harmony</em> and <em>congruity</em> of all the
parts of his story, and their fitness to bring about the
intended effect&mdash;that of striking the imagination,
touching the passions, and developing in the most
forcible manner the leading sentiment of the subject.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Much would naturally be expected from Opie
when he came to treat of 'Chiaroscuro,' for it was one
of his strong points. West said of him: 'He
painted what he saw in the most masterly manner,
and he varied little from it. <em>He saw nature in one
point more distinctly and forcibly than any painter that
ever lived.</em> The truth of colour as conveyed to the
eye through the atmosphere, by which the distance
of every object is ascertained, was never better
expressed than by him.' And the following fine
description of Opie's idea of this recondite branch of
art accordingly seems to me worthy of the painter
and writer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'Light and shade must be allowed to be the
creator of body and space. In addition to this, if
properly managed, it contributes infinitely to expression
and sentiment; it lulls by breadth and gentle
gradation, strikes by contrast, and rouses by abrupt
transition. All that is grave, impressive, awful,
mysterious, sublime, or dreadful in nature, is <ins class="corr" title="Original text: 'neally'">really</ins>
connected with <span class="smcap">it</span>. All poetic scenery, real or
imaginary, "of forests and enchantments drear,"
where more is meant than is expressed; all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
effects of solemn twilight and visionary obscurity
that flings half an image on the aching sight; all the
terrors of storm and the horrors of conflagration are
indebted to <span class="smcap">it</span> for representation on canvas; <span class="smcap">it</span> is
the medium of enchanting softness and repose in the
works of some painters, and the vehicle by which
others have risen to sublimity in spite of the want of
almost every other excellence.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>We now come to his last lecture, that on 'Colour,'
and in it note this felicitous, nay poetic, passage:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'Colour, the peculiar object of the most delightful
of our senses, is associated in our minds with all
that is rare, precious, delicate, and magnificent in
nature. A fine complexion, in the language of the
poet, is the dye of love, and the hint of something
celestial; the ruby, the rose, the diamond, the youthful
blush, the orient morning, and the variegated
splendour of the setting sun, consist of, or owe their
charms principally to, <em>colour</em>. To the sight it is the
index of gaiety, richness, warmth, and animation;
and should the most experienced artist, by design
alone, attempt to represent the tender freshness of
spring, the fervid vivacity of summer, or the mellow
abundance of autumn, what must be his success?
<em>Colouring is the sunshine of art</em>, that clothes poverty
in smiles, rendering the prospect of barrenness itself
agreeable, while it heightens the interest and doubles
the charms of beauty.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The next extract which I shall make will be the
best answer to some cavillers who used to aver that
Opie was unwilling to admit excellence in the works
of other artists:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'Like Michael Angelo in design, Titian in colouring
may be regarded as the father of modern art.
He first discovered and unfolded all its charms, saw
the true end of imitation, showed what to aim at,
when to labour, and where to stop; and united
breadth and softness to the proper degree of finish.
He first dared all its depths, contrasted all its
oppositions, and taught <span class="smcap">COLOUR</span> to glow and palpitate
with all the warmth and tenderness of real life: free
from tiresome detail or disgusting minuti√¶, he
rendered the roses and lilies of youth, the more ensanguined
brown of manhood, and the pallid coldness
of age with truth and precision; and to every
material object, hard or soft, rough or smooth,
bright or obscure, opaque or transparent, his pencil
imparted its true quality and appearance to the eye,
with all the force of harmony and light, shade,
middle tint and reflection; by which he so relieved,
rounded, and connected the whole, that we are
almost irresistibly tempted to apply the test of
another sense, and exclaim</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'"Art thou not, pleasing vision! sensible<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feeling as to sight?"'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>But the too industrious artist's health was already
beginning to break down. Exactly one calendar
month passed away, and there</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Came the blind Fury with abhorred shears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slit the thin-spun life&mdash;'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">the lecturer was silent after the delivery of the
foregoing lecture; and his busy pencil at length
idle. John Opie died, childless, in the house in
Berners Street where he had lived for sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
years, in the forty-sixth year of his age. He had
loving nurses in his devoted wife and a most affectionate
sister; he had also the advantage of no less
than six medical attendants, who saw him daily&mdash;frequently
three or four times a day. But the exact
nature of his illness seems not to have been quite
understood,<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and all was in vain; he lingered awhile,
and died, as he had lived, a painter. His friend
and pupil, Henry Thomson, R.A.,<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> had been called
in to complete the background and robes of one of
Opie's finest portraits, for the forthcoming Exhibition.
It was a likeness of the Duke of Gloucester.
'It wants more colour in the background,' said Opie,
in the intervals of his deathbed delirium. More was
added, but he continued to express himself dissatisfied:&mdash;the
delirium returned; and he continued
(in imagination) at his easel, until he breathed his
last on the 9th April, 1807.</p>

<p>And his prophecy as to his place of burial
was fulfilled: 'Aye, girl,' he once said to his
sister, 'I, too, shall be buried at St. Paul's.' There
he was laid on the 20th April (close to Barry), in
the crypt, by the side of a yet more illustrious
artist from the West-country,&mdash;Sir Joshua Reynolds.
Benjamin West's remains followed in 1820. Vandyke
had long before been buried near the same
spot. Fuseli, and Lawrence, and Turner, followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>them. Amongst the distinguished men who were his
pall-bearers were two eminent Cornishmen, Lord
De Dunstanville and Sir John St. Aubyn, his friends,
and (the former especially) his patrons.</p>

<p>We have seen something of Opie's career as an
artist, and of his grasp as a writer: it remains to say
something of his private character. The predominant
features of it seem to me to be a lofty, unselfish
ambition for excellence, a deep earnestness and stern
truthfulness combined with a most affectionate placable
disposition, a generous heart, and no inconsiderable
sense of humour. He was never idle for
a moment, his wife says&mdash;he painted all day long,
and grudged himself the shortest holiday; but he
never made sufficient progress to satisfy himself, and
would sometimes exclaim: 'I shall never, never
make a painter.' As in his youth, so in his manhood,
he was liable to fits of depression, from one of which
he especially suffered during a gloomy three months
at the end of the year 1802, when commissions for a
short while came in slowly. He recovered his spirits,
however, at the beginning of the following year, when
more work came to him, and from that time to the
very last he was full of commissions. The last work
he finished was a head of Miranda, and it was one of
his best.</p>

<p>His tastes were simple, and his ambition (except
as to his art) was moderate. To save 'a certain sum,'
Mrs. Opie tells us, in order that he might keep
a horse, and collect a good library which he could
study at his leisure, was the limit of his desires.</p>

<p>A few words may be expected as to Opie's personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
appearance and manners. As to the former, his bold,
homely, melancholy features, noble forehead and
penetrating eye&mdash;the 'index' to his mind&mdash;are tolerably
familiar to us from the fact of his having several
times painted his own portrait&mdash;Mr. Rogers catalogues
more than twenty. One of the best with
which I am acquainted is, I think, that engraved in
mezzotint by S. W. Reynolds, and selected by Mrs.
Opie to prefix to her edition of her husband's
'Lectures;'<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> but that presented by his widow to the
Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society, Falmouth, is
also a very fine one. There is another portrait,
painted by himself when a youth, at the National
Portrait Gallery; and there is one at Dulwich. And
Opie was caricatured, with six other R.A.'s, in Gillray's
'Titianus Redivivus, or the Seven Wise Men
consulting the Venetian Oracle.' He was always
somewhat careless of his personal appearance, and
frugal in his mode of life. For drawing-room society
he had no liking or capacity; but, as we have seen,
he enjoyed a good dinner-party, where sterling conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
went on, and to which he was able and
ready to contribute his quota&mdash;sometimes brusquely
enough. But on this point his friend Boaden should
be heard:</p>

<p>'I know that, to some, his frank open conduct
appeared uncalled for; nay, I have even heard it
termed coarse; but the coarse man is he who says
a thing in bad language, and not he who, with a
noble simplicity, comes immediately to the point,
and, when he has obtained conviction, in the plainest
words delivers his judgment. If I were to
attempt to characterize him in one word (I should
most certainly use that word to the honour of our
species) it would be that he was a genuine <span class="smcap">Englishman</span>&mdash;for
affectation he despised, and flattery he
abhorred.' It may be added that he regarded with
utter indifference any attacks which might be made
on his private or professional character.</p>

<p>His sledge-hammer style of expression had doubtless
something to do with the cessation of intimate
relations which took place between old Wolcot
and himself. Opie was not the sort of man to be
<em>patronized</em>, even by a 'Peter Pindar.'</p>

<p>Most of his great works live to speak for themselves.
Some of the finest examples are at Petworth;
and Dr. Waagen pronounces these almost equal to
Sir Joshua's. In energy of style, breadth, purity of
colour, harmony of tone, and exquisite chiaroscuro,
they stand very high. His portraits especially were
real and lifelike, but they were not without their
defects, and, as we see them now, are much marred
by his too copious use of asphaltum: Thackeray, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
his 'Four Georges,' even refers to them as 'Opie's
pitchy canvases.' His historical works are somewhat
deficient in imagination; and his portraits
sometimes lack dignity as well as delicacy; whilst
his style, partaking too much of his own temperament,
and even of his personal appearance, was apt
to run in a sombre vein. But a brother R.A., who
knew him well&mdash;J. Northcote, a friendly rival, and to
some extent his imitator&mdash;wrote of him: 'The toils
and difficulties of his profession were by him considered
as matters of honourable and delightful
contest; and it might be said of him that <em>he did not
so much paint to live, as live to paint</em>.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> He was
studious, yet not severe; he was eminent, yet not
vain; his disposition so tranquil and forgiving that
it was the reverse of every tincture of sour or vindictive,
and what to some might seem roughness of
manner, was only the effect of an honest indignation
towards that which he conceived to be error.'
Northcote would often exclaim to those whom he
esteemed, 'How I wish you had known Opie!'</p>

<p>And his friend Sir Martin Archer Shee, a President
of the Royal Academy, paid this final tribute to his
memory:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'His vigorous pencil in pursuit of art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disdain'd to dwell on each minuter part;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Unlike the servile herd, whom we behold<br /></span>

<p>It may be interesting to some readers to know
where the best Opies are now to be found in
Cornwall; and for information on this point I am
indebted to the following extract from a letter from
my friend Mr. Edward Opie, of Plymouth:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'As I have mentioned where Opies are <em>not</em> to be
found, I ought to state where they <em>are</em>&mdash;I mean in
Cornwall, if not removed lately. Sir John St.
Aubyn has the greatest number&mdash;I think seven or
eight. These include two portraits of his grandfather,
Sir J. St. Aubyn; one of his grandmother;
one of Captain James; one of Miss Bunn;<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> one of
Dolly Pentreath; and one&mdash;the best of all&mdash;of Mrs.
Bell, housekeeper at Clowance. This last was much
admired at one of the R.A. Winter Exhibitions.
Lady Falmouth told me she had three, if not four,
Opies. Mrs. Boscawen, you know, was an early
patroness of the painter, and invited him to breakfast,
when old Mr. Polwhele sent him into the kitchen.
The Hon. Mrs. Gilbert has four, including a beggar;&mdash;another
beggar is at Enys. Mrs. J. M. Williams,
at Carhayes, has two, both fancy pictures. At
Scorrier, Mr. G. Williams has two. At Penrose,
Mr. Rogers's, there are two or three. At Prideaux
Place, Mr. Prideaux Brune's, there are two; one
being a dog's head, the other his own portrait. At
Tregullow there are two, one being his mother
with Bible;&mdash;there are several copies of this.'</p>

calls them, are amongst the few examples
of eminent Cornishmen who,
like the Bevills, the Grenvilles, the
Lanyons, the Chamonds, the Bassets, and others,
were of Norman, or at least of French, origin.</p>

<p>In the 'Chronicum Johannis Brompton' (quoted
by John Henneker) we read:</p>

<div lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div>

<p>Leland says that St. Albin came out of Brittany;
and Camden, in his 'Remains,' names Plaus as the
place of their origin; according, however, to other
authorities, St. Aubin du Cormier in Brittany enjoys
this distinction. Of Armorican extraction, they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>therefore akin to Cornishmen, though abiding in
'Little Britain.' Possibly the name was not an
uncommon one; and either of the two above surmises
may be correct. There are now upwards of
thirty French Communes into which the name of
St. Aubin enters: to say nothing of the picturesque
little village in Jersey of that name, which fringes
the shores of St. Aubin's Bay.</p>

<p>Their first English home seems to have been in
Somersetshire; and here, in the middle of the
fourteenth century, we find Guy de St. Aubyn, or
Albin, settled at Alfoxton. It seems to have been
he who, by his marriage with Eleanor Knoville,
first obtained a footing on the Cornish soil; and,
according to Tonkin, it was his grandson, Geffrey,
who took up his abode at Clowance on the latter's
marriage with Elizabeth Kymyell of Kymyell, the
sole heir of Piers Kymyell and his wife, a daughter
of&mdash;as Tonkin assures us, 'an old and notable
Cornish family'&mdash;the house of Sergeaux, or Seriseaux.
Their son Geffrey has a monument in Crowan church,
thus inscribed:</p>

<div class="blockquot small">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p class="oefonts">
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">'Hic jacent Galfridus Seynt aubyn, Et Alicia uxor

Octobris, Anno Domini, Mill'imo cccc<sup>o</sup>; Alicia obiit
Anno Domini Mill'imo cccc<sup>o</sup>; quorum Animabus propicietur
deus, Amen.</span> Jhu mercy, lady help.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p class="noind">Since the time of the first Geffrey, the St. Aubyns, for
nearly thirty descents, have dwelt at their pleasantly
situated seat<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> at Clowance, 'the ancient house of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
an ancient gentleman,' as Norden calls it; though
the present mansion dates only from the early part
of the present century.</p>

<p>From the days of Richard II., the St. Aubyns
have frequently filled the post of High Sheriff of
Cornwall, and have also served their country as
Members of Parliament and Justices of the Peace.
For several descents they have been Baronets, until
at last the name of 'Sir John St. Aubyn, Bart., M.P.,'
has become in Cornwall a 'household word.'</p>

<p>Of the earlier members of the family I have found
little of interest, unless, indeed, it be the remarkable
physique of one of them, Sir Mauger de St. Albin,
who lived at Barnton; in Risdon's 'Devonshire,' it
is stated that he was a man of enormous strength
and stature, as is evidenced by a huge stone thrown
by him to a great distance, and by his very large effigy
on a tomb in the church.</p>

<p>On their settling in Cornwall, the St. Aubyns
followed the accustomed (perhaps the almost inevitable)
practice of intermarrying with the old county
families&mdash;the Tremeres, the Trethurfes, the Trenowiths,
the Grenvilles of Stow; and, in later times,
with the Arundells, the Godolphins, the Pendarveses,
the Killigrews, the Bullers, the Bassets, the Prideauxes,
and the Molesworths.</p>

<p>Of the fruit of one of the pre-Reformation marriages&mdash;namely,
that of Thomas St. Aubyn (who
was Sheriff of Cornwall in 1545) with Mary,
fourth daughter of Thomas Grenville of Stow, we
have a touching little notice in the MSS. Lisle
papers preserved at the Public Record Office.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Thomas is writing to his sister-in-law, Honor Grenville,
Viscountess Lisle; and the following passage
occurs in his letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'My daughter Phelyp is departyd on Crstmas
Day, Almyghtie (God) pardon her soule; and my
wyffe hath take grette disc≈çfort therbye; but, I
thank our Lord, she doth take it better way, and
thankyth god of his sending.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>From this marriage of Thomas St. Aubyn with
Mary Grenville, descended his grandson, Thomas,&mdash;the
St. Aubyn of Carew's days&mdash;of whom that
historian of his native county wrote thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'Saintabin, whose very name (besides the Conquest
roll) deduceth his first ancestors out of France.
His grandfather married Greinvile; his father, one
of Whittington's coheirs: which latter couple, in
a long and peaceable date of years, exercised a
kind, liberal, and never-discontinued hospitality.
He himself took to wife the daughter of Mallet;

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>I find nothing further of general interest touching
the family until we come to the stirring times of the
Civil War&mdash;a conflict in which Cornwall took, as is
well known, a distinguished part. Until that period
the St. Aubyns seem to have been a thriving and
distinguished family, serving their country in the
various capacities already mentioned, and 'gathering
house to house, and vineyard to vineyard.' Their
possessions were in almost every part of the county:
for instance, Lysons (who was indebted to the fifth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Sir John St. Aubyn for the loan of Borlase's MS.
folio of notes on Cornwall) says that, amongst other
properties, 'The manor of Godolphin is still held of
Sir John St. Aubyn, as of his manor of Lambourne,
by the payment of a gammon of bacon;' and, that
the manors of Berippa and Penpons were in the
possession of the St. Aubyns; also a moiety of the
manor of Gaverigan in St. Columb Major, the
manor of Argallez or Arrallas in St. Enoder, of Trelowith
in St. Erth, of half of Treninick in St. Gorran,
Kimiel and Butsava in Paul, and Mayon in Sennen;
they were also impropriators of the great tithes of
Crowan, and patrons of the Vicarage; and they held
a moiety of the advowson of the rectory of Duloe.
The revenues of the nunnery of Clares, which formerly
stood near the junction of Boscawen and Lemon
Streets, Truro, came (according to Hals) into the
possession of Sir John Seyntaubin and others; and
again, the Priory of Tywardreath, so Davies Gilbert
tells us, 'was the joint property of the St. Aubyns,
and the Pendarveses of Roscrow.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To return to the family at the time of the great
struggle between the King and his Parliament.
Most of the Cornish gentry sided, as is well known,
with the King, and behaved with such marked
valour and success as to elicit from Charles the well-known
letter of thanks which still hangs in many of
the churches in the county. One of the St. Aubyns
of the day,<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> however, seems, according to Hals, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
have thrown in his lot with the Parliament; he was
at the siege of Plymouth, in 1644; and was present
at the defeat of his party at the battle of Braddock
Down, near Lostwithiel.</p>

<p>Hals tells us that, after the rout of the Roundheads,
'it was resolved by Essex's council that he
should desert his army, and, privately by night, in a
boat, go down the river to Fowey, and from thence
take ship for Plymouth; which expedient was accordingly
put in execution, and the General Essex, the
Lord Robartes, and some others, the next day got
into Plymouth, being the 31st August, 1644. On
the same day Sir William Balfour, with two thousand
five hundred of the Parliament horse, with
divers officers, viz., Colonel Nicholas Boscawen, his
Lieutenant Colonel James Hals, of Merther, Henry
Courtenay, of St. Bennet's in Lanyvet, <em>Colonel John
Seyntaubyn, of Clowans</em>, and his Lieutenant Colonel
Braddon, Colonel Carter, and several other officers
and gentlemen of quality, early in the morning forced
their passage over St. Winnow, Boconnock, and
Braddock Downs, though the body of the King's army,
which lay encamped on the heath in those places,
maugre all opposition to the contrary; from thence
they rode to Leskeard, from thence to Saltash
Passage, and from thence to Plymouth safely the same
day, amidst their own garrison and confederates.'</p>

<p>Whether from conviction, or from a wish to be
well with either party in the State&mdash;whichever might
succeed&mdash;it seems pretty clear that another member
of the family, Thomas, espoused the cause of the
Royalists. His monument in Crowan Church so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
describes him; and in the spring of 1882 I saw,
on the walls of the principal staircase at Clowance,
his portrait&mdash;hard, but apparently faithful&mdash;in
Cavalier costume.</p>

<p>Of the second baronet I find nothing to note,
except that he was Sheriff of Cornwall in 1705.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the third<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Sir John St. Aubyn, the sturdy
little Cornish baronet&mdash;of whom Walpole said, 'all
these men (his opponents in Parliament) have their
price except him'&mdash;claims more of our attention
than, perhaps, any other member of the family. He
was born on 27th September, 1696, and we get a
glimpse of his early life, when at Exeter College,
Oxford, in the following extract from a letter written
by his friend and fellow-collegian, Borlase, in 1772,
to a lady in London. The MS. is amongst that
collection at Castle Horneck, which formed the
subject of an interesting article<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> in the <cite>Quarterly
Review</cite>, vol. 139; and the following extract describes
the homeward journey of the two young fellows. A
hundred years ago this must have been a somewhat
formidable undertaking; and we almost regret that
the chronicler did not furnish us with more details
than he has done:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'1772 &nbsp;&nbsp;* * *&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes,' writes Borlase, 'we
met with a landlord in men's clothes, but for the
most part we discovered that the men had dropt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>their prerogation, and we found the supreme
authority over the inns lodged in gowns and
petticoats. Ordered by Sir John not to write one
word of the pretty black-ey'd girl at Bridport, but to
go on with the particulars of our journey. I think I
am at liberty to tell you of a misfortune which
happened to me at Launceston. As we were passing
though that fatal town (I am heartily sorry I
have forgot what day of the month 'twas), but, however,
as we were passing through, whom should we
see at the door of an inn but our landlord's daughter!
Whether Sir John was dry and thirsty or not I can't
tell, but we all agreed to take our pint at the door,
and being men of no little gallantry because just
come from town, we were talking very smartly, as
you may imagine, to the girl who filled the wine,
when all of a sudden, my unfortunate eyes happened
to fix upon a green ribbon that hung playing to-and-fro
with the air a little lower than it should. As I
was the only person that discovered it, I told the
lady I was apprehensive she would lose that pretty
ribbon if she did not withdraw. I was then on
horseback, and, to my great confusion, had not the
presence of mind to alight and take care of it myself,
upon which Sir John has so teased and bantered me
that I have had no rest ever since. I beg you would
write Sir John, and let him know that such a misfortune
deserves rather pity than upbraidings. And
now, Madam, I suppose you are almost as tired with
our journey as we are, or (to go as far as possible
with the comparison) as three of Sir John's horses,
which we left upon the road.'</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The writer of the article goes on to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>'We must now turn away for a moment from the
pleasant scenes at Ludgvan, and follow Borlase's
friend of college days as he enters the chapel at St.
Stephen's&mdash;the youngest member, perhaps, of that
distinguished assembly. Born in the year 1700, Sir
John St. Aubyn was only just of age when, in 1722, he
was returned to Parliament for his native county. Different
indeed, yet in one respect alike, had been the
destinies of the friends since we left them after their
journey in the beginning of the year. Parting, the
one to mix in the affairs of State in times the most
perplexing, the other to the peaceful seclusion of his
country parsonage; each had, nevertheless, marked
out for himself a path of mental activity. That
the confidence of his country, though entrusted
to so young a man, had not been misplaced, may be
judged from an extract in the correspondence before
us. Thus, a gentleman writing from London,
March 2nd, 1726, observes: "Sir R.&mdash;&mdash; [Sir
Robert Walpole] this Session has met with a strong
opposition in the House of Commons; Sir John St.
Aubyn has gained a great reputation in that House,
and the opinions of our politicians in relation to war
or peace are as different as their faces."</p>

<p>'A year or two later an incident in Cornish history
gave him an opportunity of making himself more than
ever beloved at home. In 1727, when, as Hume tells
us, "the Courts of France and Spain were perfectly
reconciled, and all Europe was freed from the
calamities of war, the peace of Great Britain was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
disturbed by tumults amongst the tinners of Cornwall,
who, being provoked by a scarcity of corn, rose
in arms and plundered the granaries of the county."
At this time it happened that Sir John had just completed
a new pier at the Mount, to facilitate the
exportation of tin, which was shipped in large quantities
at that place.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> The consequence was that the
tinners congregated in considerable numbers; the
place became a rendezvous for malcontents, and
fresh riots broke out. Very serious consequences
were apprehended, and what might actually have
happened none can say, had it not been that the
magnanimous spirit and unselfish patriotism of the
young statesman showed itself in a measure of local
policy which doubly endeared him to his countrymen.
He "forthwith advanced a considerable sum
of money to the tinners, by which they were saved
from starving, or the necessity of plundering their
neighbours." "Constant in his attendance and application
to the business of the House of Commons,"
writes Borlase, in a note attached to the St. Aubyn
pedigree, "he soon learnt to speak well, but spoke
seldom, and never but on points of consequence.
He was heard with pleasure by his friends, and with
respect by others." In 1734 he seconded the repeal
of the Septennial Act, in a speech which will be
found in the "Handy Book of British Eloquence."'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
And here we must leave the <cite>Quarterly</cite> Reviewer for
awhile, in order to give a sample of Sir John's
oratorical powers. I quote from the report, in the
<cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for 1734, of his speech of the
13th March, on seconding Mr. Bromley's motion.</p>

<p>Sir John began by vigorously sketching the characters
of those monarchs who were fond of 'Long
Parliaments,' and thus referred to the Parliaments of
Charles II., who, he said, 'naturally took a surfeit
of Parliaments in his Father's time, and was therefore
extremely desirous to lay them aside. But this
was a scheme impracticable. However, in effect he
did so, for he obtained a Parliament, which by
its long Duration, like an army of Veterans, became
so exactly disciplined to his own Measures, that they
knew no other command but from that Person who
gave them their Pay.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'This was a safe and a most ingenious way of
enslaving a Nation. It was very well known that
Arbitrary Power, if it was open and avowed, would
never prevail here. The people were therefore
amused with the Specious Form of their Antient
Constitution; it existed, indeed, in their Fancy; but,
like a mere Phantom, had no Substance nor Reality
in it, for the Power, the Authority, the Dignity of
Parliament were wholly lost. This was that remarkable
Parliament which so justly obtained the opprobrious
Name of "Model," from which, I believe, some
Later Parliaments have been exactly copied.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>He then went on to describe the evils of Long
Parliaments, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'But this must be the Work of Time. Corruption
is of so base a Nature, that at first sight it is extremely
shocking. Hardly anyone has submitted
to it all at once. His Disposition must be previously
understood; the particular Bait must be found out
with which he is to be allured; and, after all, it is
not without many struggles that he surrenders his
Virtue. Indeed, there are some who will at once
plunge themselves over Head and Ears into any base
Action; but the generality of mankind are of a more
cautious Nature, and will proceed only by some
leisurely Degrees. One or two perhaps have deserted
their Colours the first Campaign; some have
done it in a second. But a great many who have
not that eager Disposition to Vice will wait till a
Third.</p>

<p>'For this reason, Short Parliaments have been
less Corrupt than Long Ones; they are observed, like
Streams of Water, always to grow more impure the
greater Distance they run from the Fountain-head.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The independent speaker finished with this spirited
peroration:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'The Power of the Crown is very justly apprehended
to be growing to a monstrous&mdash;I should have
said, too great&mdash;a Size, and several Methods have
been unsuccessfully proposed for restraining it within
due Bounds.</p>

<p>'But our Disease, I fear, is of a complicated
Nature, and I think that this Motion is wisely
intended to remove the first and Principal Disorder.
Give the people their antient Right of frequent new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Elections; That will restore the decay'd Authority
of Parliament, and will put our Constitution into a
natural Condition of working out her Cure. Sir,
upon the whole I am of opinion that I can't express
a greater Zeal for his Majesty, for the Liberties of the
People, or the Honour and Dignity of this House,
than in seconding the Motion which the Hon. Gentleman
has made you.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>It should be remembered that such sentiments
as these were uttered to an audience&mdash;not
of his constituents, whom he might have felt bound
to please, but to a thoroughly corrupted House of
Commons, at a period when '<em>not</em> to be corrupted
was the shame;' and in the presence of a powerful
Minister, whom few men of the day were either
strong or virtuous enough to dare to thwart. The
chubby, youthful-faced portrait of the little Sir John
hangs in the dining-room at Clowance: childish
the face may be; but, as if in apology for his small,
juvenile presence, he points with his right hand to
the Mount, to indicate that his principles were as
firm and unshaken as that 'hoar rock.'<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>Quarterly</cite> Reviewer (from whom we again
quote), after concluding his observations on Sir
John's speech in 1734, goes on to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'In the same year a curious incident occurred in
the neighbourhood of his seat at Clowance, with
which Sir John was only indirectly connected in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
his capacity of Justice of the Peace, but which was
ultimately attended with very serious consequences
to himself and his family. A certain Henry Rogers,
by trade a pewterer, having some fancied claim to
an estate called Skewis, seized the manor house,
and, surrounding himself with a band of cut-throats,
organized a rebellion on his own account, and bade
defiance to the country round. Having beaten off
from his house, not without bloodshed, first the
sheriff, next the constables, and finally the military
themselves, the villain succeeded in making good
his escape. He was subsequently arrested at Salisbury,
and brought to Launceston for trial, where
the grand jury found five bills of murder against
him, and Lord Chief Justice Hardwicke publicly
returned thanks to Sir John "for his steady endeavours
to bring him to justice."<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>'The terror, however, which this ruffian caused
in the neighbourhood can scarcely be realized nowadays,
and the menacing letters received by Lady
St. Aubyn so preyed upon her mind, that they brought
on a "sensible decay," or, as we should call it now,
a rapid decline, from the effects of which, in 1740,
she died.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>'With the death of his wife, Sir John's interest
in country life came to an end; and leaving his son
to the care and instruction of his old friend at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>Ludgvan, he set out for a foreign land. Meanwhile,
however, the parliamentary horizon was rapidly
clouding over; a crisis was clearly imminent; and,
on his return to England, it was to find that, for
the present at least, his sorrow must be drowned
in more work, in a redoubled attention to those
duties which his early reputation now pointed to
him to fulfil. And thus, as the Walpole Administration
draws on to its close, the figure of Sir John
St. Aubyn&mdash;the "little baronet," as he was called&mdash;comes
prominently to the front as one of the
most vigorous, as he certainly was the most conscientious,
of the opponents of the then unpopular
Prime Minister. On the subject of the vote of
thanks, including an approbation of the manner in
which the Spanish War had been prosecuted, which
was carried by a small majority in the House of
Commons early in 1741, he writes (April 9th) as follows:
"I believe ye Folks in ye country are very much
puzzled abo<sup>t</sup> many of our Proceedings, and I don't
wonder at y<sup>r</sup> doubts about that unseasonable vote
of Innocence; especially when ye Opportunity was
so fairly given, w<sup>ch</sup> ye Nation has been so long
expecting us to take ye advantage of." But the
country party the while felt that no opportunity
must be lost, and no vigour spared in the attack.
Contrast the tone of the following extract from a
letter dated May 5th, and note how the space of
one single month had served to fan the flame. Sir
John now inveighs against "such Insolence in
Administration, such wantonness in Power, w<sup>ch</sup>
surely nothing could produce but that mistaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
vote of Innocence, w<sup>ch</sup> so lately happen'd. And yet,"
he continues, "this is y<sup>e</sup> Man ag<sup>t</sup> whom we want evidence
to advise his Removal, when at my very door there
are such glaring Proofs, which, in less corrupt times,
would deprive Him of his Head." Day by day the
enemies of the Ministry acquired fresh strength:
the elections were against the Court interest, even
Westminster returning two members hostile to it.
Walpole tottered on the brink of ruin, and had it
not been that, during a short adjournment of the
House in 1742, he resigned his office and was
elevated to the peerage, he might, as we know, even
have been committed to the Tower.</p>

<p>'No sooner had Parliament reassembled than a
measure was brought in by Lord Limerick, and
seconded by Sir John St. Aubyn, to inquire into
the conduct of the last twenty years. This was
lost by two votes; but another, also proposed by
Lord Limerick on the 23rd of March, for an inquiry
into the conduct of Robert, Earl of Orford, was
carried, and a Select Committee appointed by
ballot. And now came Sir John's political triumph.
To this committee he was appointed by every vote
in the House of Commons, to the number of 518.
"An honour," says the MS. from which we quote,
"neither then nor before (as far as the Records of
Parliament can reach) ever conferred on any member,
as Mr. Speaker Onslow on the spot observed
to Sir John's great commendation." When the
committee was appointed he declined the offer of
the chair, and Lord Viscount Limerick was chosen
chairman. The following is an extract from a letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
of Sir John's, dated from the Secret Committee
Chamber, June 22nd, 1742: "We are now," he
writes, "winding up our bottoms as well as we can
under y<sup>e</sup> disabillitys which we have been fetter'd
with, nothwithstanding which, we shall show the
world enough to convince if not convict. I am
sorry there has been so much unconcern in y<sup>e</sup>
Gentlemen of our country; I wish I could say in
some an unconcern only. We have had, and I
wish we mayn't for ever now have lost, y<sup>e</sup> only
opportunity which may happen to retrieve y<sup>e</sup>
Honour and establish y<sup>e</sup> National Institutions of
y<sup>e</sup> Country.... The Town is in high spirits at
present, upon the accounts we have from Germany
and Italy. This turn is not owing to y<sup>e</sup> merit of
y<sup>e</sup> new Administration, but to y<sup>e</sup> Vigour of this
Parliament, which has had Its free Operation
during this Inter-Regnum of Power, and whenever
that happens, England must have Its due Influence
upon y<sup>e</sup> Continent; and if she had acted
as she ought for some years past, what might
have been brought about, when y<sup>e</sup> bare expectation
of her acting has produc'd such great
events?"</p>

<p>'"About this time," says Dr. Borlase, "Sir John
being offer'd to take place as one of the Lords of the
Admiralty, he was ready, he said, to serve his King
and country, but would take no place unless upon
the express condition that his freedom and independency
in Parliament should remain unquestioned
and uncontroll'd. These were not times to endure,
much less shake hands with such inflexible Virtues;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
as he coveted no place, he never had one, 'though
capable of any.'"</p>

<p>'On the 31st March, 1744, when war was declared
with France, the inhabitants of Mount's Bay became
alarmed for the safety of their trade. Two things
were required; a stationary armed vessel to protect
their shores and fisheries from privateers (for three
of the principal fishermen had already been taken
prisoners), and a cruiser to convey the exports and
imports necessary for working the mines. For the
part he took in obtaining these advantages, Sir John
received the thanks of the gentlemen of the neighbourhood,
assembled as usual in their Parliament
at the Bowling Green at Marazion. St. Michael's
Mount he had restored from a ruined monastic cell to
a comfortable dwelling-house; but he never lived to
visit it again, dying of fever, at Pencarrow, on his
way home in the year 1744, at the early age of forty-four;
"to the great regret of all who knew him; and
to his country's loss of a most faithful friend."</p>

<p>'"The dignity of this ancient family," writes Borlase
in the brief memoir attached to his pedigree, "owes
much to this gentleman;" and Dr. Oliver, of Bath, in
a letter of sympathy on the occasion of his death,
speaks of him as "one who had bravely withstood
all the temptation that honours or profit could lay
in his way, and dared to stand almost single on
the field of Purity, while thousands fell on his right
hand and ten thousands on his left, the easy Prey
of corruption." Farther on he adds, "Let us thank
Heaven who lent us the great, good man so long,
and neither wonder nor murmur at his being taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
from us so soon, especially when we consider how
little Influence his Example had upon Earth."
There is something in a character like his which
renders it worthy of the admiration and the love
of generations; nay, of centuries, far beyond his
own.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The year before he died the following verses
appeared in the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> (vol. xiii.)

the poet may have had the unassailable integrity of
his Cornish acquaintance in his mind when he wrote
the last line of the couplet which I have prefixed by
way of motto to this chapter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of the fourth baronet it will suffice to record that,
having taken the degree of M.A. at Oriel College,
Oxon, in 1747, he became a member for Cornwall in
1761, and continued to sit for the county for eleven
years. His monument in Clowance Church sums up,
sufficiently for our purpose, his character and his
career:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p class="small">'To the memory of Sir John St. Aubyn, Baronet, who, by his descent
from a long line of worthy ancestors, and a father distinguished by
honest zeal and prudent moderation, was recommended to the important
trust of representing in Parliament the county of Cornwall; and
justified the confidence of his electors by unshaken constancy of
principle, uniting with the dignity of his public character the domestic
virtues of tenderness and friendship. This monument was erected by
his disconsolate widow. He was born the 12th of Nov., 1726. He
died 12th Oct., 1772.'</p>
</div>

<p>But the fifth baronet of the same familiar name
will demand somewhat more of our time and attention.
He was the son of the last-mentioned Sir John
St. Aubyn, was born on the 17th May, 1758, and was
educated at Westminster; where, when a lad of
seventeen, he had an amusing escapade. He and
another hopeful young gentleman, his schoolfellow,
joined in a bond for raising money to enable them to
obtain the delights and luxuries which the discipline
of the school and the extent of their pocket-money
denied. The inevitable day came for repayment
of the moneys advanced. It was in vain that 'infancy'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
was pleaded against the suit of the London
money-lender; the precocious financier was ordered
to pay back the sums he had borrowed, and interest
at four per cent. A lad of so much enterprise was
evidently designed to make some figure in the world,
and we accordingly find him, when only twenty-six
years old, contesting the county in 1784. He made
another unsuccessful attempt six years afterwards;
but, nothing daunted, once more essayed to obtain
a seat in Parliament, and on this occasion succeeded
in securing his election for Penryn. He afterwards
sat for Helston from 1807 to 1812.</p>

<p>But it does not appear that he took any very prominent
part in political life, his tastes leading him
rather to the pursuit of the arts and sciences; and
accordingly we find that he was elected a Fellow of
the Royal Society, of the Society of Antiquaries, and
of the Linn√¶an Society. In 1804, in conjunction
with others, he proposed to establish, at the Royal
Institution, at a cost of ¬£4,000, a mineralogical
collection and an Assay Office, on a large scale, for
the improvement of the study of mineralogy and
metallurgy; but the scheme failed for want of funds,
although Sir Humphry Davy, Lord Dartmouth,
and one or two more took great interest in the
matter, and contributed valuable collections of
minerals, etc. Here it may be mentioned that Dr.
Wm. Babington dedicated to Sir John<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> his 'New
System of Mineralogy.' It was, in fact, a catalogue
of the Baronet's own collection, much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
which had previously belonged to the Earl of
Bute.</p>

<p>As evidencing his fondness for art, it may be observed
that he was from first to last the discriminating
friend and patron of his fellow-countyman, John Opie,
R.A.; and it may be added that he was one of the pall-bearers
at the artist's funeral. To Opie he entrusted
the painting of his portrait (mezzotinted by W. Barney),
which now hangs in the Town Hall of Devonport.
In this town the family of St. Aubyn has
long held large possessions, the value of which the
fifth baronet is said to have increased three or fourfold,
although he is said to have embarrassed the
family estates for many years by the singular provisions
of his will. When Sir John's collection of
engravings and etchings were sold at Phillips's
Auction Rooms, in April, 1840, the sale attracted
the presence of most of the principal connoisseurs in
the kingdom; and to give some idea of the vastness
of the collection, it may be added that the sale lasted
for seventeen days.</p>

<p>It is not surprising to find that, with such tastes
as his, Sir John St. Aubyn found London a more
congenial place of abode than Cornwall. In the
metropolis, therefore&mdash;at 63, Portland Place&mdash;or in
its vicinity&mdash;as at Short Grove, Saffron Walden, or
at Woolmers, Hertford&mdash;he lived; and, close to
London he died&mdash;at Putney, on the 10th August
1839&mdash;at the good old age of eighty-one. He was
noted for his beneficence, and for his refined and
courteous manners; and these virtues and graces are
suitably recorded on his monument at Crowan. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
the occasion of his funeral, advantage was taken of
his popularity (especially amongst the Freemasons,
of which body he was a prominent member) for his
body to 'lie in state' at St. Austell, Truro and
Clowance; and his remains were followed to the
grave by between 20,000 and 30,000 persons&mdash;a
multitude as numerous as their sorrow was
sincere.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It has not been my practice to refer to any of the
living representatives of the families whose histories
I am endeavouring to sketch, but it can hardly be
out of place on this occasion to observe that Sir John
St. Aubyn, the present baronet, has also been for
more than a quarter of a century a Member of Parliament
for Cornwall; and that, to say the least, he is
not likely to tarnish the lustre which surrounds the
names of the past St. Aubyns of Clowance and the
Mount.</p>

 would not be unreasonable to inquire
how it can be necessary now to write an
account of Richard Trevithick, seeing
that only nine or ten years ago two
elaborate volumes on the subject were published by
his son Francis.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> But, apart from the propriety of
including so remarkable a man in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fasciculus</i> of our
Cornish worthies, it may be observed that the very
amplitude of the 'Life' to which I have referred
renders it inaccessible to the general reader; and
moreover it is (as the talented civil engineer who
wrote that valuable and interesting work himself
observes), almost as much a technical history of the
development of the steam-engine as a memoir of him
who was so intimately associated with its rise and
progress. Our purpose is biography; and, unless I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
am grievously mistaken, this aspect of the subject
will be found full of interest.</p>

<p>The steam pumping-engine is to a mine what the
heart is to a man: were its action to cease, or to be
inefficiently performed, the mine would be flooded,
and would cease to be. It is therefore not to be
wondered at if, so soon as men ceased to find the
precious ores in granules on the surface, washed
down by mountain streams from the denuded veins
which seam the hillsides, attention should be directed
towards finding the coveted treasures in the bowels
of the earth itself. But here a difficulty met
the searchers. As they sunk their pits they often
tapped the sources of streams, which, gushing out,
at once put an end to their quest. Rude expedients
were at first employed to remedy this; wooden
pumps, worked by the hand, and such-like feeble
attempts at getting over the difficulty. But it was
not until 1702 that, according to some accounts, the
first steam pumping-engine was erected in Cornwall,
by Savery. Newcomen, whose name will always be
honourably associated with the improvement of this
invaluable machine, very soon was able to increase
its efficiency, and erected one of his best engines in
1720, at the mine-works of Ludgvan-lez, near
Penzance. By 1756 there were <em>several</em> steam-engines
at work in Cornwall; but their defects, especially as
regards their low power, and their extravagant consumption
of coal, were inconveniently felt. It was
at length perceived that the solution of the difficulty
lay in a diminution of the size of the boiler, and an
increase in the elastic force of the steam; and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the accomplishment of these objects we are mainly
indebted to the subject of this memoir, as well as,
in some degree, also to his father. The circumstances
which surrounded them were by no means
encouraging. Coal, of course, had to be imported,
and also iron plates for the boilers; and the latter
it was necessary, in those days, to make of small
size, on account of the indifferent condition of the
Cornish roads, along which (as no heavy wheeled-traffic
was practicable), the burdens had to be transported
from the ports to the mines, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>,
on the backs of mules. Now-a-days the huge
boilers are moved entire, and there are few more
gladsome as well as picturesque sights to be seen
in Cornwall than the transit of a gigantic new
boiler through the streets of one of the West-country
towns. It means that mining enterprise, which has
flagged of late years, owing to the increased importation
of foreign ores, and has caused deep depression
and cruel poverty in many a Cornish home, is
awakening once more; and the teams of thirty or
forty horses, with their noisy conductors, and the
ponderous mass which slowly toils along the weary
road, are hailed with shouting and songs. We see,
then, of what vital interest to a mining county, such
as Cornwall, must ever be all that is connected
with that seemingly prosaic structure, the steam-engine;
and how full of interest, to Cornish folk
at least, should be the story of any Cornishmen
who have been prominently connected with its development
and history. Such certainly were the
Trevithicks, especially the younger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>Though in later times they settled in the western
part of the county, the family seems to have sprung,
in the sixteenth or seventeenth century, from Trevemeder,
a 'town place' in the seaboard parish of St.
Eval, four or five miles north-west of St. Columb
Major, a parish which contains some of the finest cliff
scenery in Cornwall, at the far-famed Bedruthan
Steps and Sands. Some of the family monuments
are still to be found in the church, which lies two
miles south of Trevemeder.</p>

<p>The elder Trevithick, who, like his more illustrious
son, was christened Richard, was born in 1735; and
that he was a man of sound judgment and much
force of character may be surmised from his having
been appointed, when only thirty years of age,
manager of some of the leading Cornish mines, in
days when mine-managers were expected to be their
own engineers. In 1760 he married Ann Teague,
one of a family (said to be of Irish extraction) distinguished
for many a long year past in the annals of
Cornish mining. By her, a woman of large and
portly figure,<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> he had a tall stately family of
four daughters and one son, all of whom were, I
believe, born in an unpretending house amongst the
mine-heaps which lie between Dolcoath and North
Crofty, in sight of the noble hill of Carnbrea crowned
with its old castle, and still more antique remains of
ancient Britons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
An example of the elder Richard's inventive skill
as an engineer was given when he repaired, or rather,
almost reconstructed, about 1775, Newcomen's old
Carloose, or Bullan Garden engine; especially by
adding thereto a strong top of new form to the
boiler, a drawing of which is given in the Appendix
to Price's 'Mineralogia Cornubiensis,' 1778. The
old boiler-tops were scarcely more than kettle-lids,
and were actually weighted down in order to keep them
in their places; indeed, there is a tradition that the
first Cornish boilers were nothing more than stone
fire-places! In effecting this improvement Richard
Trevithick, senior, was assisted by one John Harvey,<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
the founder of the celebrated firm of Harvey and Co.,
of Hagle Foundry, of whom we shall hear more by-and-by.</p>

<p>But about 1777 Watt, the celebrated 'low-pressure'
engineer, appeared on the scene with his improvements
in the steam-engine; travelling into
Cornwall for the purpose of obtaining orders, erecting
his first engine at Wheal Busy, and exciting the
most angry jealousy on the part of all the local mine-managers
and engineers&mdash;and notably our Richard:
who, however, had the magnanimity and good sense
at length to acknowledge and to adopt many of his
illustrious rival's improvements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
The old man, who was a pious Methodist, a 'class-leader,'
and an intimate friend of John Wesley, died
when sixty-two years old at Penponds, near Camborne,
on the 1st August, 1797, and, I believe, was buried on
the summit of Carn Brea, but no monumental stone
marks the spot. The whole of his life was spent
amongst mines and steam-engines, an industry which
was deeply depressed at the time of his death;
and Richard, the younger (who had married Jane,
John Harvey's tall and buxom daughter, shortly
prior to his father's decease), may be said to have
succeeded to a 'heritage of woe: 'not one in ten of
the steam-engines which his father had contributed
so much towards putting into operation being at that
time at work, and our hero had almost to begin the
<ins class="corr" title="Original text: 'world anew'">work anew</ins>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So much as the foregoing seemed necessary in order
to rightly estimate Trevithick's position and surroundings
when he had arrived at the age of twenty-six.
But it will now be desirable to retrace our steps, and
begin at the beginning. He was born in the centre
of a group of some of our most important Cornish
mines, in the parish of Illogan, on the 13th April,
1771, one of a family of five, of whom Richard was
the only surviving son, and, as a matter of course,
his mother's pet. One can picture the tall, sturdy
lad, 'creeping reluctantly' to the little school at
Camborne, where he was reputed a lazy, inattentive,
and obstinate pupil, always drawing upon his slate
lines and figures, unintelligible to any but himself,
but, likely enough, containing the germs of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
inventions which were destined hereafter to contribute
largely to the success of Cornish mining, and
make his own name famous. As he grew up he seems
to have been more noted as a wrestler, and for his feats
of strength, than for anything else, except, perhaps,
for his rapid power as a mental arithmetician. He
was a great hand at throwing the sledge-hammer,
and could lift half-a-ton. A huge mass of iron of
about this weight, which tradition says Trevithick
used to lift, is still shown at the Patent Museum,
South Kensington. He would climb the mine-shears&mdash;a
height of fifty or sixty feet&mdash;stand, balancing
himself on the summit, and then and there swing
round his sledge-hammer 'to steady his head and
foot.' There is a story told of his being attacked by
pickpockets while walking with his friend, Captain
Andrew Vivian, in London; but Trevithick seized two
of them, knocked their heads together, and then flung
them away from him in opposite directions, not to
return to the Tartar whom they had caught! The
mark was long shown on the ceiling of Dolcoath
account-house, which was imprinted by the <em>heels</em> of
one Captain Hodge, who had dared Trevithick to try
a fall with him, but who found himself first flying
through the air, and then flat on his back on the
table, before he knew what had happened!</p>

<p>But Richard Trevithick was endowed with something
more than mere physical strength; for, having
first received some instruction in his calling from an
engineer, well-known in Cornwall, of the name of
Bull, he at length got to work, in 1790, at Stray
Park Mine, at 30s. a month. Whilst here he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
selected, when only twenty-one years of age, to report
upon the relative merits of Watt's and Hornblower's
engines, a fact which, surely, speaks volumes for his
powers of observation, and for the solidity of his
judgment.</p>

<p>In 1795 he erected at Wheal Treasury, when his
pay was 3s. 6d. a day, his double-acting steam-engine&mdash;a
model of which is still, I believe, in operation
at Battersea&mdash;and in 1796 or 1797, he removed
to Ding Dong Mine, near Penzance. It was about
this time that he, fortunately for himself, met with
Davies Gilbert, of Tredrea, afterwards President of
the Royal Society, whose impressions of Trevithick
are recorded in the following letter to J. S. Enys,
Esq., of Enys:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p class="right small">'Eastbourne, April 29, 1839. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>'<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br /></p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I will give as good an account as I can of
Richard Trevithick. His father was the chief
manager in Dolcoath Mine, and he bore the reputation
of being the best informed and most skilful
captain in all western mines; for as broad a line of
distinction was then made between the <em>Eastern</em> and
<em>Western</em> mines (the Gwennap and the Camborne
Mines) as between those of different nations.</p>

<p>'I knew the father very well, and about the year
1796 I remember hearing from Mr. Jonathan Hornblower,
that a tall and strong young man had made
his appearance among engineers, and that on more
than one occasion he had threatened some people
who had contradicted him to throw them into the
engine-shaft. In the latter part of November of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
year I was called to London as a witness in a steam-engine
case between Messrs. Boulton and Watt and
Maberley. Then I believe that I first saw Mr.
Richard Trevithick, Jun., and certainly there I first
became acquainted with him. Our correspondence
commenced soon afterwards, and he was very
frequently in the habit of calling at Tredrea to ask
my opinion on various projects that occurred to his
mind&mdash;some of them very ingenious, and others so
wild as not to rest on any foundation at all. I cannot
trace the succession in point of time.</p>

<p>'On one occasion Trevithick came to me and inquired
with great eagerness as to what I apprehended
would be the loss of power in working an engine by
the force of steam raised to the pressure of several
atmospheres; but instead of condensing, to let the
steam escape. I, of course, answered at once that
the loss of power would be one atmosphere,
diminished power by the saving of an air-pump with
its friction, and in many cases with the raising of
condensing water. I never saw a man more
delighted; and I believe that within a month
several puffers were in actual work.</p>

<p class="right">'<span class="smcap">Davies Gilbert.</span>' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Thus was born the <em>high-pressure</em> engine, with which
the name of Richard Trevithick will for ever be
associated; and in a few months many of these
machines were at work, notwithstanding Watt's
allegations that they were dangerous to public
safety. Indeed Trevithick, writing to Davies Gilbert,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>observed that 'James Watt said,  ... that I deserved
hanging for bringing into use the high-pressure
engine.' Trevithick never afterwards reverted to
the low-pressure model. And here it may be observed
that Mr. Michael Williams considered that
this invention, in conjunction with Trevithick's
improved cylindrical boiler, doubled or trebled the
work done by the old Boulton and Watt engines.
The saving to the Cornish mines thus effected by
Trevithick has been estimated at nearly ¬£91,000
per annum.</p>

<p>He was now in full swing of work; much to the
surprise of his father, was engaged in twenty
different mines; and was everywhere recognised as
a worthy successor of his father, and as the chief
Cornish engineer in the county.</p>

<p>It was at this time, too (1797), that he married
Jane Harvey. A tall man, 6 feet 2 inches high,
broad-shouldered, as most Cornishmen are, with a
massive head, bright blue eyes, and a large but
shapely mouth, with a firm but kind expression.
His bust was presented to the Royal Institution of
Cornwall by Mr. W. J. Henwood, and his portrait&mdash;by
Linnell, in 1816&mdash;is preserved at the National
Portrait Gallery at South Kensington.</p>

<p>The young couple took up their abode at Moreton
House, near Redruth, close to the residence of
Murdock, the inventor, in 1792, of the gas-light.
Watt lived not far off, at Plain-an-Guarry (the
Playing-place), but the two rival engineers did not
visit each other. Watt and his engines were patronized
by the <em>Eastern</em> or Gwennap mine-owners, but
Trevithick and his inventions were adopted by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Camborne, Illogan and Redruth or <em>Western</em> adventurers.
As an instance of the strong feeling which
existed in those days between the rival mine-engineers,
Smiles, in his 'Lives of Boulton and
Watt,' states that it was reported that old Captain
Trevithick and Murdock had actually fought a duel
over the subject of their inventions.</p>

<p>From Redruth, after only a few months' residence
there, Richard and his wife moved to Camborne.
Whilst here, and about this time, he invented
his improved plunger-poles, the forcer temporary
pump, the plunger-pole pump, the pole-pressure<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
engine, and the double-acting pressure-engine for
Wheal Druid; all of them greatly conducing to the
facilities required for removing the water out of deep
mines.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> He seems, too, to have been particularly
happy in the methods which his versatile ingenuity
employed in adapting old machinery to more modern
requirements; and, though he was always busy as a
bee, he was full of fun and good-humour, and noted
for being a capital story-teller.</p>

<p>But Trevithick did not confine himself to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>steam pumping-engine. The improvements which
he and others had made and were making in that
most important machine necessitated improvements
in other parts of the mine. The ore must be drawn
more rapidly to the surface, and the mode of sending
it up the shafts must be improved. He was equal to
the occasion: the steam whim solved the former,
and the wrought-iron kibble (formerly a bucket, constructed
of wood) the latter difficulty. About this
period an amusing incident occurred which is
worth recording, as exhibiting Trevithick's force of
character in other than merely professional matters.
His remuneration would appear to have consisted
partly of a fixed salary, partly of the profits incident
to the supply of machinery, and partly of royalties
payable upon instruments of his invention. Now
one of his engines was supplied to a mine called
Wheal Abraham, whose shareholders, on somewhat
fanciful and possibly unfair grounds, appear to have
unnecessarily delayed satisfying Trevithick's just
claims; whereupon, one night, the engineer and his
men took the matter into their own hands, and
(to the astonishment of the staff of the mine next
morning) removed the huge engine bodily.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We now approach a very interesting episode in
Trevithick's career&mdash;namely, the invention of his
'Camborne common road-locomotive.'<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> The idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
of this may possibly have suggested itself to him (as
doubtless other causes suggested similar ideas to
Murdock, and to others before and after Trevithick)
from his having to transport one of his portable
engines from mine to mine, as required&mdash;sometimes
at a considerable cost. To such a practical genius
as his the idea doubtless occurred, 'Why not, with all
this available power, make the engine move herself?'
However this may be, the curtain now rises on an
amusing little group in Trevithick's house; Davies
Gilbert acting as stoker, and Lady De Dunstanville
of Tehidy (on whose estate most of the great Camborne
Mines were situated) playing the part of engine-man
to a little model locomotive which ran round the
table. The original working model of 'the Trevithick
high-pressure locomotive,' the first working model for
which was made in 1797, is still to be seen at the South
Kensington Museum, in the machinery department;
but it was not till Christmas Eve or (according to
other authorities) Christmas <em>Day</em>, 1801, that the
'puffing devil,'<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> as it was locally termed by the
astonished Cornish folk, made its first performances
on the roads round Camborne, Tuckingmill, and
Tehidy, carrying its ten or a dozen passengers uphill
faster than a man could walk. The success,
though not complete, was sufficient to determine
Trevithick, with his brother-in-law Andrew Vivian&mdash;who
found the money and shared in the speculation&mdash;to
proceed forthwith to London in order to obtain
a patent (his first), which was accordingly secured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
on the 24th March, 1802. Smiles points out, in his
'Lives of the Engineers,' that a remarkable feature
in this engine was that it not only raised but also
depressed the piston by the action of the steam; and
he also tells how, in 1803, the wonder was exhibited
to the public first at Lord's Cricket Ground, and
afterwards near the spot where the London and
North-Western Railway Station, Euston Square, now
stands. This engine attained a speed of twelve miles
an hour. When the noisy machine worked its way
along Oxford Street, all horses and carriages were
ordered out of the way; many of the shops were
shut for fear of accidents, and the roofs of the houses
were crowded with spectators. I believe it was also
exhibited at one time on the site of the present
Bedlam. To Trevithick, also, Smiles awards the
credit of 'putting <em>the two things</em> together&mdash;the steam-horse
and the iron way,' when he invented his
second or <em>railway</em> locomotive. The controversy
as to the priority of the invention has been thus
ably summed up in the following extract from
'Locomotive Engineering,' by Zerah Colburn, C.E.
(vol. i., pp. 32, 33; 1871):</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'As a true inventor, no name stands in so close
connexion with the locomotive-engine as that of
Richard Trevithick. It was he who first broke
through the trammels of Watt's system of condensation
and low, if not negative, pressure; it was he
who first employed the internal fire-place and
internal heating surface; he was the first to create
or promote a chimney-draught by means of exhaust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
steam; the first to employ a horizontal cylinder
and cranked axle, and to propose two such
cylinders with the cranks at right angles to each
other; the first to surround the cylinder with hot
air; the first to draw a load by the adhesion of
a smooth wheel upon a smooth iron bar; <em>and
the first to make and work a railway locomotive-engine</em>.
Trevithick and George Stephenson were
contemporaries;<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> the first locomotive seen by the
latter was constructed by the former; and a
personal acquaintance was afterwards established
between them. Although irrelevant to the present
purpose, it may be added that Trevithick patented
the screw-propeller, and specified several forms of
that instrument, and various modes of applying it, in
1815&mdash;years before those to whom the invention is
more commonly ascribed had turned their attention
to it.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The history of steam locomotion by rail was thus
conveniently summarized by a writer in the <cite>Times</cite>,
on the occasion of the George Stephenson Centenary,
8th June, 1881:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'It may be mentioned that there were iron railways
before Stephenson's time. The earliest
account is of a timber tram-line laid down near
Newcastle in 1602. Lines were made of iron at
Whitehaven in 1738. In 1776 an iron railway was
laid down near Sheffield, by John Curr, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
destroyed by the colliers. Ten years later the first
considerable iron railway was laid down at Coalbrookdale.
The first iron railway sanctioned by
Parliament&mdash;with the exception of local lines used
by canal companies&mdash;was the Surrey iron railway,
worked by horses, from the Thames at Wandsworth
to Croydon, laid down in 1801. <em>In the year 1802
Trevithick and Vivian obtained a patent for a high-pressure
locomotive engine.</em> In 1813 William Hedley,
of Wylam Colliery, constructed the first travelling
locomotive engine in a colliery; and in the following
year<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> the first locomotive constructed by George
Stephenson travelled at the rate of six miles per
hour.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Notwithstanding, however, this practical success,
from a pecuniary point of view Trevithick's position
was far from flourishing. It is true that he was
engaged, not only on his Cornish work, but also at
Pen-y-darran in South Wales, at Coalbrookdale,
and at Newcastle-on-Tyne; and it is also true that
the exhibition of his 'Catch-me-who-can' engine,
as Mr. Davies Gilbert's sister named the railway
locomotive, working on a circular railway of about
100 feet in diameter, drew crowds of Londoners
to witness its performance. But the shilling admission
fees did not come in fast enough to counterbalance
the legal difficulties which our engineer had
to contend with in the working of ill-defined Patent
Laws; and the breaking of a rail caused the engine
to overturn&mdash;thus putting an end to the exhibition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Ill-health, too&mdash;typhus, gastric, and brain fever
supervened; bankruptcy and imprisonment were
the result; and, to anticipate a little, poor Trevithick
was driven from London, after an unsuccessful
application had been made to the Government
for remuneration for his truly national services.
He was not only, as his biographer contends, the
real inventor of the blast-pipe; but, up to 1808, had
constructed two road-locomotives (one for Camborne
and one for London), railway locomotives for Coalbrookdale
and Newcastle, and a tramroad locomotive
for Pen-y-darran; to say nothing of his
steam-dredger engine, his travelling steam-crane,
his brilliant though ineffectual attempt to construct
a driftway under the Thames at Rotherhithe,<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
etc., etc.</p>

<p>The following extract from the 'Catalogue of the
South Kensington Museum' gives the official account
of Trevithick and his patents:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'<em>Inventor and constructor of the first high-pressure
steam-engine, and the first steam-carriage used in
England</em>; constructor of a tunnel beneath the
Thames, which he completed to within 100 feet of
the proposed terminus, and was then compelled to
abandon the undertaking; inventor and constructor
of steam-engines and machinery for the mines of
Peru (capable of being transported in mountainous
districts), by which he succeeded in restoring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Peruvian mines to prosperity; also of coining-machinery
for the Peruvian mint, and of furnaces for
purifying silver ore by fusion; also inventor of other
improvements in steam-engines, impelling-carriages,
hydraulic engines, propelling and towing vessels, discharging
and towing ships' cargoes, floating-docks,
construction of vessels, iron buoys, steam-boilers,
cooking, obtaining fresh water, heating apartments,

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>But this list by no means exhausts the whole of
his inventions, for he was so fond of talking of them
before they were matured that many were found
sharp enough to seize Trevithick's ideas, and then to
reduce them into some practical and remunerative
form for themselves.</p>

<p>Sorry reward this for such incessant industry and
varied inventive skill as induced Hyde Clarke to
write as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'In the establishment of the locomotive, in the
development of the powers of the Cornish engines,
and in increasing the capabilities of the marine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
engine, there can be no doubt that Trevithick's
exertions have given a far wider range to the
dominion of the steam-engine than even the great
and masterly improvements of James Watt effected
in his day.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> for October, 1867, has an
article on 'George Stephenson and Locomotion,' in
which George Stephenson is described as 'the father
of railway locomotion;' and yet two pages after
(p. 499) the writer of the article mentions, with
greater accuracy, Richard Trevithick (or, as he spells
it, 'Trevethick') as 'the first who put together the two
ideas of the steam horse and the iron way.' Alas
for our Cornishman! such is fame! It has been
shown above that Trevithick not only first put
together the steam horse and the iron way, but that
he first worked the steam horse on the turnpike
road; and to <em>him</em> therefore is due the chief credit
for there being 'not a line or a locomotive which
does not bear testimony to his genius, his sagacity,
and his perseverance; nor is there a traveller upon
a railway, who saves time, money, fatigue and
anxiety ... who has not reason to think of <em>Richard
Trevithick</em> with gratitude for the benefits which he has
conferred, and with admiration for the intellectual
triumphs which he achieved.'</p>

<p>Fortunate it was for him that he was a remarkably
good-tempered man, most simple and frugal in
his habits, and richly endowed with that 'friend of
the brave'&mdash;Hope!</p>

<p>His freedom from debt and imprisonment seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
to have been at length due to the sale of one of his
patents for iron tanks (for ships) and iron buoys, to
Mr. Maudslay, founder of the now eminent firm of
London engineers of that name. Trevithick had
pressed his proposals on the Admiralty for a long
time in vain; and at last, with characteristic impetuosity,
settled the matter for ever, it is said, by
calling the Navy Board to their faces 'a lot of old
women.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Trevithick now joined her husband in
London, but not until after prolonged importunity
on his part; and her reluctance is scarcely to be
wondered at when we think of the difficulties which
then existed in making the journey from Cornwall
to the metropolis. She had to post all the way,
three hundred miles, with four children, one of them
a baby, and probably with no servant. Besides
which, her brother, Mr. Henry Harvey, of Hayle,
represented to her that Trevithick's position in
London was hardly sufficiently assured as yet to
warrant her making the move. Conjugal love,
however, at length prevailed over every other consideration;
and on her welcome arrival, a touching
little incident occurred. She found her two last
letters, unopened, in her husband's pocket; and on
her reproaching him with this seeming forgetfulness,
which she attributed to his being so thoroughly
immersed in his multifarious engineering schemes,
he confessed that he had not dared to open them,
lest her arguments against their reunion should have
prevailed over his wishes. It was well for both that
the faithful wife came to town: for soon afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
had she not ransacked London for a doctor,
whilst her husband lay almost dying in a sponging-house,
it is unlikely that he would have survived to
return to his native county. To Cornwall, however,
he at length returned, in broken health and spirits, in
1810, to find that his mother had just died. Trevithick
went home by sea, a six days' voyage, and, as
we were then at war with France, the <i>Falmouth
Packet</i> in which he sailed was under convoy. They
were chased by a French man-of-war, from whom
they luckily escaped; her commander little dreaming
that his small craft (which seems to have owed
her safety chiefly to her captain's knowledge of the
coast) had on board her the man who had laid proposals
before the Government for fitting vessels
with high-pressure engines and launching them
against the French fleet equipped at Boulogne for
the invasion of England.</p>

<p>Trevithick's first idea of steam navigation appears
to have arisen in 1804, though his specification was
not dated till 1808;<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and in this, as in almost every
other important step in his life, he relied very much
on the sound judgment and sympathetic advice of
his friend Davies Gilbert. Paddle-wheels, however
(the original mode of propulsion), were found cumbrous
to ships, especially in heavy weather; and
this led Trevithick to the invention of the screw-propeller,
a design for which he laid before the Navy
Board in 1812, but without effect. The patent was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
not dated till the 6th of June, 1815; nor was success
assured until after the busy engineer had left his
native county on a voyage to Peru, which seemed
to hold out promises of proving an El Dorado
for him. His son and biographer, taking into
consideration the numerous marine inventions and
appliances of his progenitor, claims for his father,
and not without much show of justice, that he may
be regarded as the originator of our present iron
steam fleet.</p>

<p>But, in fact, the man's versatility in his profession
seems to have been unbounded. In 1813 he was
the life and soul of the arrangements for constructing
the Plymouth Breakwater; then he turns his
attention to the manufacture of agricultural engines,
and constructs the first steam thrashing-machine,
which was until recently at work at Trewithan, in
Probus, but now occupies a place of honour in the
South Kensington Museum of Patents, together with
a boiler of curious construction by him.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> This invention,
like some others of Trevithick's, seems to
have been almost still-born; yet it was destined, as
we now know, to re-appear as a powerful factor in
the development of agriculture.</p>

<p>His next great stride was the new 'pole-puffer-engine'
of 1816, in connection with which squabbles
arose between the engineer and his relations, Henry
Harvey and Andrew Vivian, both of whom were
said to have been moved to jealousy by Trevithick's
having arranged to get the castings for the first of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
these engines (viz., that for Wheal Herland, near
Gwinear) made at Bridgenorth, instead of at Hayle.
The first trial of the new engine, when at length set
up, seems to have been somewhat of a failure, owing
to the inaccurate way in which it was made. Here
is an eye-witness's amusing account of its starting:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'I was a boy working in the mine, and several of
us peeped in at the door to see what was doing.
Captain Dick Trevithick was in a great way; the
engine would not start. After a bit, Captain Dick
threw himself down upon the floor of the engine-house,
and there he lay upon his back; then up he
jumped, and snatched a sledge-hammer out of the
hands of a man who was driving in a wedge, and
lashed it in, in a minute. There never was a man
could use a sledge like Captain Dick; he was as
strong as a bull. Then he picked up a spanner, and
unscrewed something, and&mdash;off she went! Captain
Vivian was near me, looking in at the doorway.
Captain Dick saw him, and, shaking his fist, said,
"If you come in here, I'll throw you down the
shaft." I suppose Captain Vivian had something to
do with making the boilers, and Captain Dick was
angry because they leaked clouds of steam. You
could hardly see, or hear anybody speak in the
engine-house, it was so full of steam and noise; we
could hear the steam-puffer roaring at St. Erth,
more than three miles off.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Another altercation on the subject of this engine
took place at a meeting of the Wheal Herland
adventurers, when Trevithick said: 'I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
not help threatening to horsewhip Joseph Price
for the falsehoods that he, with the others, had
reported. I hear that he is to go to London to
meet the London Committee on Monday. I hope
the Committee will consider J. Price's report as
from a disappointed man. It is reported that he
has bought very largely in Woolf's patent, which
now is not worth a farthing, besides losing the
making my castings, which galls him very sorely.'</p>

<p>The final result was that the Wheal Herland
engine proved a great success.</p>

<p>'Every engine that <em>was</em> erecting is stopped, and
the whole county thinks of no other engine,' wrote
its engineer; and that Trevithick had 'the courage
of his convictions' may be judged from his saying:
'I have offered to deposit ¬£1,000 to ¬£500 as a bet
against Woolf's best engine, and give him 20,000,000
(lbs. "duty"), but that party refuses to accept the
challenge.' Indeed, Mr. Francis Trevithick claims
that '<em>This engine performed the same work as the Watt
engine, with less than half of the daily coal</em>.'</p>

<p>It would, in fact, be difficult to exaggerate the
importance of Richard Trevithick's contributions to
this branch of applied mechanics; and had he been
as prudent in his management of his business affairs,
and as sharp in looking after his pecuniary interests
as he was brimful of talent in his scientific inventions,
it would never have been necessary for the late
Mr. Michael Williams, M.P.,<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> to write of him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
'he was at the same time the greatest and the worst-used
man in the county.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such was Trevithick's position when he had
reached the age of forty-five. Sanguine, impetuous,
and brilliant&mdash;no sooner finishing one invention than
commencing another (nay, sometimes before he had
thoroughly completed the first)&mdash;a benefactor of
incalculable extent to the prosperity of his native
county, but so unsuspecting and so indifferent to his
own, that he turned at length to the New World for
the appreciation and reward that he had failed to
secure in the Old.</p>

<p>The circumstances which led to this determination
are somewhat curious. A desire having been felt
amongst several wealthy Spaniards in Peru to rework
certain of the old gold and silver mines which
required draining, Don Francisco de Uville, of Lima,
a Swiss gentleman, was sent to England to search for
the best steam pumping-engines for their purpose.
The names of Messrs. Boulton and Watt were so
famous, that, almost as a matter of course, he first
consulted them; but they discouraged the project,
mainly on the grounds that the rare atmosphere of
the Cordilleras would interfere with the efficiency of
the steam-engine. Thus rebuffed, and much dejected,
he chanced to see in the window of a shop, near the
spot where the 'Catch-me-who-can' had been exhibited,
a small model of one of Richard Trevithick's
engines, which he at once secured for ¬£20, and
hastened back with it to Peru. Arriving there, he
at once put its powers to the test, and was delighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
to find that Boulton and Watt's doleful prophecies
were not fulfilled. Accordingly he forthwith returned
to England with the model, which bore Trevithick's
name engraved on it, in search of the engineer who
had constructed the wonderful machine, and had
the good luck to find on board the same ship as that
in which he made the voyage a cousin of Trevithick's&mdash;a
Mr. Teague&mdash;who at once put the Don on the right
track. Satisfactory interviews ensued, large orders
for engines were put in hand&mdash;pumping-engines,
winding-engines, sugar-rolling engines, and crushing-engines,
to the tune of some ¬£16,000. The anticipated
profits were ¬£50,000 a year, and Trevithick
was to be paid, not in money, unluckily for him, but
in shares, which were to secure to him an income of
¬£10,000 per annum.</p>

<p>At length the engines duly arrived at Lima, and
were landed under a salute from the guns of the
batteries. But things did not work well. The men
sent out were unaccustomed to the use of wood-fires,
and they failed to carry out all Trevithick's instructions,
whereupon he himself resolved upon going to
the rescue; and accordingly he sailed from Penzance
in a South Sea whaler, the <i>Asp</i>, on 20th October,
1816, intending to land at Buenos Ayres and work
his way across the South American continent&mdash;an
undertaking which, in those days, it need scarcely be
added, was of a most formidable character, and no
doubt, therefore, was all the more attractive to the
remarkable man whose career we have been considering.</p>

<p>On his arrival in Peru, he was received with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
almost royal honours, and, at once getting to work,
soon set matters to rights; for by the early part of
1817 there were four engines at work, including that
used for coining at the Mint. An immediate collapse
of the whole undertaking would probably have
been the result but for the timely arrival of 'Don
Ricardo,' as he was styled by the natives. Amongst
the difficulties to be overcome in this enterprise may
be mentioned those of transit, and these may be
estimated from the facts that the Cerro de Pasco
Mines were 170 miles from Lima, that the roads
were for the most part mule-tracks only, and that
the site was 13,400 feet above the sea! No wonder
that, on his eventually triumphing over all these
difficulties, thoughts were seriously entertained of
erecting a statue to him in solid silver, and that,
according to Mr. Walker's memoir, he was made a
Marquis and Grandee of Spain. But the whole
scheme was unhappily doomed to failure. Deaths
and dissensions took place amongst the shareholders;
Uville died in August, 1818, and the whole brunt of
the management fell upon Trevithick. He now, too,
foolishly engaged in other undertakings whilst his
hands were already sufficiently full, and lost large
sums of money in a speculative process for extracting
silver by smelting instead of by amalgamation.
Then a war of independence broke out, and poor
Trevithick had the mortification of learning that the
Royalists had actually destroyed his machinery, and
flung it&mdash;where he had so often before threatened to
fling <em>his</em> enemies&mdash;'down into the shafts.'<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
This was the death-blow of the affair, and he immediately
set to work on a fresh venture, namely, the
raising of the cannon from a Russian ship which had
been sunk near Callao. By this he readily made no less
than ¬£2,500, but&mdash;will it be believed?&mdash;he forthwith
lost it all by an imprudent speculation in a pearl-fishery
at Panama! Some of the money would have been
particularly acceptable to poor Mrs. Trevithick,
whom her thriftless husband had left at Penzance
unprovided for; in fact, he omitted (doubtless from
sheer thoughtlessness) to pay, as he had promised to
do, the house-rent a year in advance for her. Another
curious instance of Trevithick's utter incapacity for
understanding business matters appears in the following
anecdote. Being very hardly pressed for
payment of some account due from him, he snatched
the bill from his creditor, and writing, 'Received&mdash;Richard
Trevithick,' at the foot of it, handed it back
to the poor man with an angry exclamation, in his
strong Cornish dialect, of 'There! will that satisfy
you?'</p>

<p>A strange episode in his career now occurs.
Bolivar actually pressed him as a soldier; but Trevithick
soon 'tir'd of war's alarms,' and the President
readily allowed him to return to more congenial
pursuits, sending him on some special mission to
Bogota&mdash;yet not before Trevithick had signalized
his connexion with the army by inventing a most
ingenious carbine with an explosive bullet. Whilst
in South America he also became, for the nonce, a
surgeon, and actually amputated both legs of a poor
fellow crushed by the fall of some of Trevithick's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
heavy machinery. The man was very proud of what
he had undergone, and used to boast of his capital
stumps.</p>

<p>Having previously paid a short visit to Chili,
Trevithick (who had now lost all his property)
finally left Peru in 1822, on the above-named special
mission; but, distrustful of Bolivar's promises and
hearing of something more to his advantage, as he
considered, he made his way to certain rich mines
that he had heard of in Costa Rica instead. Thither&mdash;to
that region of snakes, miasma, and earth-quakes&mdash;we
must now follow him.</p>

<p>There were known to be rich mines of the precious
metals near Quebradahonda, in the interior of the
little tract of mountainous country which forms part
of the narrow belt of land connecting North and South
America; but the difficulties of access in 1826-27
rendered them almost valueless, and Trevithick and
his party conceived the idea of approaching them
from the Atlantic side, by a route which should be
practicable for steam conveyances&mdash;namely, by way
of San Juan (now Greytown) and the rivers San
Juan de Nicaragua and Serapique. Rafts and boats
were constructed for the descent of those streams,
and fearful hardships and dangers befell the explorers&mdash;who
were bent upon accomplishing a somewhat
similar task in Central America to that which Lander
had performed a few years before in Western Africa.
Three weeks were spent in accomplishing their
object&mdash;during which the little party subsisted
on monkeys and wild fruits; and more than once
Trevithick, an indifferent swimmer, but who managed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
to buoy himself up by bundles of sticks which he
placed under his arms, was nearly drowned. He had
however, at length the gratification of reaching San
Juan&mdash;the first European who had made the voyage
from Lake Nicaragua to the sea.</p>

<p>By some means or other he contrived to reach
Cartagena (de las Indias) on his homeward journey,
disconsolate enough no doubt; but what befell him
on his way is best told in the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p class="right small">'Stanwick, Cumberland, 27th November, 1864. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>'<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I read in the public prints that in a speech
made by you in Belle Vue Gardens you referred to
the meeting of Robert Stephenson with Trevithick
at Carthagena, which, if your speech be correctly
reported, you attribute to accident. The meeting
was not an accident, although an accident led to
it, and that accident nearly cost Mr. Trevithick his
life; and he was taken to Carthagena by the gentleman
that saved him, that he might be restored.
When Mr. Stephenson saw him he was so recovering;
and if he looked, as you say, in a sombre and silent
mood, it was not surprising, after being, as he said,
"half drowned and half hanged, and the rest devoured
by alligators," which was too near the fact
to be pleasant. Mr. Trevithick had been upset at
the mouth of the river Magdalena by a black man
he had in some way offended, and who capsized the
boat in revenge. An officer in the Venezuelan and
the Peruvian services (Mr. Bruce Napier) was
fortunately nigh the banks of the river shooting wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
pigs. He heard Mr. Trevithick's cries for help, and
seeing a large alligator approaching him, shot the
reptile in the eye, and then, as he had no boat,
lassoed Mr. Trevithick, and by his lasso drew him
ashore much exhausted and all but dead. After
doing all he could to restore him, he took him on
to Carthagena, and thus it was he fell in with Mr.
Stephenson, who, like most Englishmen, was reserved,
and took no notice of Mr. Trevithick, until
an officer said to him, meeting Mr. Stephenson at
the door, "I suppose the old proverb of two of a
trade cannot agree is true, by the way you keep
aloof from your brother chip. It was not thus your
father would have treated that worthy man, and it
is not creditable to your father's son that he and
you should be here day after day like two strange
cats in a garret; it would not sound well at home."
"Who is it?" said Mr. Stephenson. "<em>The inventor
of the locomotive</em>, your father's friend and fellow-worker;
his name is Trevithick&mdash;you may have heard
it," said the officer; and then Mr. Stephenson went
up to Trevithick. That Mr. Trevithick felt the previous
neglect was clear. He had sat with Robert
Stephenson on his knee many a night while talking
to his father, and it was through him Robert was
made an engineer. My informant states that there
was not that cordiality between them he would have
wished to see at Carthagena.</p>

<p>'The officer that rescued Mr. Trevithick is now
living. I am sure he will confirm what I say if
needful. A letter will find him if addressed to
No. 4, Earl Street, Carlisle, Cumberland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>'There are more details, but I cannot state them
in a letter, and you might not wish to hear them if
I could.</p>

<p class="center">'I am, sir, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

Hall.</p>

<p class="small">'To E. W. Watkin, Esq., M.P.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>On recognising Stephenson, Trevithick is said to
have exclaimed, 'Is that Bobby!&mdash;I've nursed him
many a time.' The younger engineer had ¬£100 in
his pocket, and generously gave his senior half of it
to facilitate his return to England, which Trevithick
shortly afterwards accomplished, by way of Jamaica,
in the autumn of 1827, landing at Falmouth on the
9th October, after a weary, anxious absence of eleven
years. His health does not seem to have been much
injured; but his belongings were simply the clothes
he stood upright in, a gold watch, a pair of
dividers, a magnetic needle, and a pair of spurs. A
friend had to pay his passage-money before he could
leave the ship which brought him home.</p>

<p>But he had the happiness of finding his wife and
their family of four sons and two daughters all well.
The Church bells rang out a merry peal of welcome;
and he was entertained at the houses of all the principal
people in the county. A great deal was said of the
handsome remuneration which was due to him for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
having been the means, through his many inventions,
of saving Cornwall half a million of money,&mdash;but
little or nothing seems to have come of all the talk;
and when he claimed ¬£1,000 from each of the leading
mines which had adopted his machinery, they
seem&mdash;so far as I can ascertain, with one exception
only&mdash;to have repudiated them. The exception to
which I refer was a compromise of his claims by the
Messrs. Williams, of Scorrier, in respect of certain
mines in which they were interested, for the sum of
¬£150. Nor was his petition to Parliament, dated
27th February, 1828, setting forth his many truly
<em>national</em> claims for consideration, and containing an
interesting summary of his inventions (but unfortunately
too long to reproduce here), more successful.</p>

<p>Trevithick was now verging upon sixty years of age,
and found that he had to begin life anew. His first
endeavour was to form a company to work his mines
in Costa Rica, but neither he nor his friend Gerard
could succeed in doing this either in England, in
France, or in Holland; and, if the report be true that
he refused a cheque for ¬£8,000 for his share in the
mine-grants, he must have lived to repent it bitterly.
However, his busy brain was soon at work again
with inventions. First an iron ship and a gun with
friction-slides; then a recoil gun-carriage, in which he
utilized the recoil somewhat after the manner since
so effectually accomplished by Moncrieff; then we
find him suggesting a mode of making ice by steam.
Next he invents a chain-and-ball pump for draining
the Dutch marshes; and, soon after, we hear of his
being employed by the Government of that country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
to examine into sundry important engineering works
which they had in hand, whilst poor Trevithick had
to borrow ¬£2 from a friend to enable him to get over
to Holland for the purpose. It may be mentioned,
to show what a good-natured fellow he was,
that he at once gave 5s. out of this to a poor
neighbour who had had the misfortune to lose his
pig.</p>

<p>During a great part of this period of his life Trevithick
was at Hayle Foundry, engaged in the construction
of the great draining engines for Holland;
but he, nevertheless, found time for further inventions,
notably for applying tubular boilers, a superheating
system, and surface-condensers to marine
engines, to say nothing of his proposals to make the
same water act over and over again by alternate
expansion and contraction, so as to avoid the
objectionable necessity for using salt water in the
boilers. By his method marine engines occupied
only half their former space; were half the weight;
and consumed half the fuel that they formerly did:
and it would scarcely be too much to say that his
genius rendered the first voyage across the Atlantic
practicable. In connexion with this subject, he took
out his eighth and last patent in 1832.</p>

<p>Perhaps his latest project was as original&mdash;not to
say Utopian&mdash;as any that even his fertile brain
ever conceived. It was to erect a perforated, gilt,
cast-iron column, 1,000 feet high, to commemorate
the passing of the Reform Bill. One novel feature
in it was the air-elevator, which worked in a tube in
the centre of the column, and shot the traveller from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
the base to the summit, on arriving at which he
was to secure a glorious bird's-eye view of London.</p>

<p>But the end was approaching. He had been in
indifferent health in the spring of 1830; and, although
his son does not state the causes of his father's death,
there is too much ground to fear that poverty and
misery at least accelerated it. He was at work in
April, 1833, in Messrs. Hall's factory, at Dartford,
Kent, probably on one of his marine engines, when,
on the 22nd of that month, somewhat suddenly&mdash;for
his relations knew nothing of his illness&mdash;the great
engineer died. He was penniless, and was indebted to
charity for his grave, and to the mechanics of Messrs.
Hall's factory for becoming the bearers and the only
mourners at his simple funeral.</p>

<p>Unless a tombstone has lately been erected,
Richard Trevithick furnishes another example of
one of Cornwall's most illustrious sons being without
a monument to mark where he lies. Is this
creditable to the county, or the country, in which he
was born, or to the age which he so much enriched
by the versatile power of his genius?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since the above was written,&mdash;and also since the
date of a letter which I sent to the Cornish papers
in June, 1881, calling attention to the facts above
referred to,&mdash;endeavours have been made to procure
some fitting record in Cornwall in honour of Trevithick's
memory; and an influential meeting on the
subject was held in London on 20th April, 1883.</p>

 nest of the Vivian family was Truro;
here our hero was born, and here resided
his father, John Vivian, who may be
called the founder of the copper trade
in Cornwall, and who subsequently became Vice-Warden
of the Stannaries: but the present seat of
the Vivians is Glynn, the ancient residence of the
Glynn family, from which place the subject of the following
remarks, Richard Hussey, first Baron Vivian
of Glynn and Truro, derived the former of his titles.
He derived his second name from his grandmother,
who was a Miss Hussey, of Okehampton; his
grandfather was the Rev. Thomas Vivian, of Comprigney,
Kenwyn; he was vicar of Cornwood, Devon,
and was a man of some literary ability.</p>

<p>Well do I remember, when I was quite a youngster,
an autumnal visit in 1842 to the well-wooded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
valley which Glynn overlooks, and through which
rushes the Fowey, a lovely trout-stream, when the
'fiery finger' had been laid upon the leaves of the
myriad-tinted oaks in its glades; and when Death
had just claimed the owner of that noble mansion.
On the grand staircase hung the great picture by
Shee,<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> representing the lithe figure of the tall,
bronzed hero advancing in his hussar uniform, dismounted
and bareheaded, fresh from the 'rapture of
the fray;' whilst in the background was a servant
holding a spirited white charger. I thought then,
and think so still, that I had never seen a more goodly
presence.</p>

<p>Vivian's mother was as much distinguished for
her beauty and vivacity as his father was as an
upright man of business, and able administrator of
the Stannary laws. She was a daughter of the
Rev. Richard Cranch, vicar of St. Clement's, near
Truro, an early friend and patron of Sir Joshua
Reynolds; and, accepting her own admission,
must have had a sufficiency of admirers. 'What
a fine creature she was!' said Dr. Wolcot ('Peter
Pindar'). 'I once told her in jest that she <em>must</em>
be my wife, for I had never been so deeply in
love before.' 'It is out of the question, my dear
doctor,' she replied; 'it is impossible. I am <em>five
deep</em> already!' The charming buxom profile of the
good old lady, who died in 1816, might until recently
have been seen on her cenotaph at St. Mary's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Church, Truro;<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> as well as a medallion portrait,
on his marble tomb (with an epitaph), of her eldest
and illustrious son, the subject of this notice.</p>

<p>He was born at Truro&mdash;probably at the house to
which reference has just been made&mdash;on 28th July,
1775; and when about eight years old was sent to
the Truro Grammar School under Dr. Cardew.
Here, however, he did not long remain, as we find
him from 1784 to 1787 at school at Lostwithiel, from
which place he went direct to Harrow.</p>

<p>Another three years of his life were passed there;
and in 1790 he entered at the old West-Country
College&mdash;'Exeter'&mdash;at Oxford; but he only kept two
terms. His education seems to have been completed
by a visit to France in 1792.</p>

<p>The time had now come for Vivian to choose a
profession; and in this important matter one hardly
knows whether to admire more the liberality of the
father, or the instinctive sagacity of the son. Mr.
Vivian wished his heir to follow a pursuit in which distinction
had been gained both by himself and by other
members of the family, and an attempt was made in
this direction. Our hero was accordingly articled to
a Mr. Jonathan Elford, a solicitor, of Devonport,
with a view to Vivian's becoming a 'counsellor,
learned in the law;' but the attractions presented
by the lives and the uniforms of the officers of a
garrison town were an all-powerful opposing force;
and, besides, Vivian could urge family precedents for
a military career; for was not his great-uncle, Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
Hussey, amongst the heroes who fell with Wolfe on
the heights of Abraham?<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly, an ensign's commission in the 20th
Regiment of Infantry was procured for him on 31st
July, 1793. In the following year he got a captaincy
in the 28th, and was present in all the affairs of that
time between the French and British armies in the
Low Countries; his regiment suffering severe losses
at Geldermalsem. In 1795 he returned to England;
and shortly afterwards made an attempt&mdash;the second
unsuccessful one&mdash;to get with his regiment to the
West Indies. But the war god had other and higher
services in store for Vivian; and the winds and the
waves drove back the transports to the British shore.</p>

<p>For the next two years (1796-98) Vivian was doing
garrison duty at Gibraltar. This sort of pursuit
must have fretted so high a spirit as his, and probably
led to his exchanging into a cavalry regiment,
the 7th Light Dragoons, or 'Queen's Own' Hussars;&mdash;now,
at least, he thought he should be sure to see
service. Nor was he disappointed; for in 1799 he
took part in the unfortunate Texel Expedition, under
Sir Ralph Abercombie, one result of which, however,
was the capture of Helder on the 28th August in
that year.</p>

<p>To Vivian the piping times of peace during the
next four or five years gave an opportunity for turning
his thoughts from war to love; and in 1804 he
married his first wife, Eliza, daughter of Philip
Champion De Crespigny, of Aldborough (with whom,
so the story goes, he ran off from a boarding-school).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
She was descended from an old French family,
refugees from the Edict of Nantes; and the fruit of
this marriage was two sons and three daughters.</p>

<p>The Peninsula was destined to be the scene of
Vivian's next exploits; and in 1808 we find him
landing with Sir John Moore at the once busy port
of Corunna. He was engaged in most of the cavalry
affairs during that brief campaign, and led the
rear-guard during the historic retreat in January,
1809, collecting the infantry stragglers to the number
of about 600, forming them, and so repulsing a pursuing
enemy, almost as weak and winter-stricken as
themselves. For his skill and valour on this memorable
occasion he obtained the thanks of Sir G.
Paget. He also received high commendation from
that gallant hero and graceful gentleman, Sir John
Moore himself, whose masterly tactics were recognised
by his generous antagonist Soult's placing a
monument to his remains on the Corunna ramparts,&mdash;celebrated
in the ode with which we have all
been familiar from our childhood.</p>

<p>After an interval of repose for about three years
in Ireland, during which he was made Aide-de-camp
to the Prince Regent, and attained the rank of
a Colonel in the army, in 1813 Vivian was ordered
to take part in the Peninsular campaign; and, in
the August of that year, he landed at Bilbao&mdash;'the
beautiful ford'&mdash;that scene of so many conflicts
between the French and the Allies. He was now
appointed Colonel on the staff, and had the command
of a brigade of cavalry; and in the latter
capacity he was present at most, if not all, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
important cavalry affairs in that campaign&mdash;gathering
laurels at Orthes, Vittoria, and in the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>Vivian particularly distinguished himself in the
following year at Croix d'Orade; of his conduct on
that occasion there is no better description than that
which is contained in the following extract from the
Duke of Wellington's despatches to Earl Bathurst:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p class="right small">'Toulouse, 12th April, 1814. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>'I have the pleasure to inform your lordship that
I entered this town this morning, which the enemy
evacuated during the night.... The continued fall
of rain and the state of the river prevented me from
laying the bridge till the morning of the 8th, when
the Spanish corps and the Portuguese artillery  ...
crossed the Garonne. We immediately moved forward
to the neighbourhood of the town; and the
18th Hussars, under the immediate command of
Colonel Vivian, had an opportunity of making a
most gallant attack upon a superior body of the
enemy's cavalry, which they drove through the
village of Croix d'Orade, and took about one hundred
prisoners, and gave us possession of an important
bridge over the river Ers, by which it was necessary
to pass in order to attack the enemy's position.
Colonel Vivian was unfortunately wounded upon
this occasion, and I am afraid that I shall lose the
benefit of his assistance for some time.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>For this affair he bore on his coat of arms
(amongst other allusions to his brave deeds) a flying
pennon inscribed with golden letters, 'Croix d'Orade.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
The wound referred to by the Duke was from a
carbine-shot in the right arm.</p>

<p>It is curious to contrast the Great Duke's appreciative
eulogy of this brilliant exploit with Napier's
sour version of it in his 'English Battles and Sieges
in the Peninsula' (p. 453, ed. 1873): 'In this operation
a single squadron of the 18th Hussars, under
Major Hughes, being <em>inconsiderately</em> pushed by
Colonel Vivian across the bridge of St. Martin de la
Touch, suddenly came upon a regiment of French
cavalry. The rashness of the act, as often happens
in war, proved the safety of the British; for the
enemy, thinking a strong support must be near, discharged
their carbines, and retreated at a canter.
Hughes followed; the speed of both parties increased;
and as the road did not admit egress by the sides,
this great body of horsemen was pushed headlong by
a few men under the batteries of St. Cyprian.'</p>

<p>When the late Chaplain-General Gleig disputed a
statement of Napier's relating to the battle of Vimiero,
the latter writer fell back on the authority of the
Duke of Wellington, which, of course, Napier preferred
to that of Gleig, adding tartly, that 'the two
authorities may be weighed by those who are
fastidious.' A similar process may be recommended
as to Wellington and Napier's authority touching
Vivian's share in the affair at Croix d'Orade. It
may also be well to add the significant fact that the
18th Hussars presented Vivian with a sword of
honour on the occasion.</p>

<p>The year 1814 was further memorable in our
hero's annals. The Transitory Peace was signed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
Vivian was promoted to the rank of Major-General;
returned to England; and was appointed to the
command of the Sussex Military District, taking
up his residence at Brighton. On thus giving up
his connexion with the Hussars, his brother officers
presented him with a piece of plate worth 250
guineas.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The curtain rises upon the eventful year 1815&mdash;the
year in which Napoleon's ambitious career was
to be at once and for ever checked by the Iron Duke
on the field of WATERLOO.</p>

<p>Vivian, now a Knight Commander of the Bath,
was the first major-general sent in command of a
brigade of cavalry to join the army assembling at
Brussels; and did 'yeoman's service' during the
few days which preceded the great battle, notably
covering the retreat (as at Corunna) of the army
whilst falling back from Quatre Bras on Waterloo.</p>

<p>It would of course be out of place here (even if
the familiar histories of the great battle, given by
Siborne, Alison, and Hooper, had not also made
it unnecessary) to attempt any description of that
world-renowned fight. But Vivian's share in it
demands more than a passing notice; and this I
have drawn up from the authorities whom I have
mentioned, as well as after having made a visit to
the field of battle; and from other sources.</p>

<p>It may be premised that, at Waterloo, Vivian commanded
the 6th Brigade of Cavalry of the British and
King's German Legion. It was composed of the
1st, 10th, and 18th Hussars, numbering, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
Siborne, 1,279 sabres. They were at first stationed
on the <em>extreme left</em> of the first or main portion of
the British line. The 10th and 18th regiments were
in line in rear of the road to Wavre, and withdrawn
a little from the crest of the ridge, the right of the
10th resting upon a lane. The 1st Hussars were
also in line, and formed the reserve. The extreme
left of this brigade was completely <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en l'air</i> (<em>i.e.</em>, unsupported),
upon high, open, and flat ground. A
piquet, consisting of a squadron of the 10th,
occupied the village of Smohain, and their vedettes
were within half-carbine-shot of some of the French
cavalry. Vandeleur's brigade of light horse was on
Vivian's right.</p>

<p>But the frequent and furious charges of the enemy
made it necessary, as the anxious, bloody day wore on,
to strengthen the Duke's left centre; and accordingly
in the sheet of Siborne's Atlas representing the field
at a quarter before eight p.m., when the Prussians had
begun to arrive, Vivian's cavalry appear as then occupying
the <em>middle</em> of the much-weakened British
force, close at the rear of the Brunswickers and Nassauers.
This change of position was effected on
Vivian's own responsibility, and to the great satisfaction
of the Duke; for when these fresh troops took
up their position, the British cavalry had been reduced
to mere skeletons of regiments. It is not difficult to
fancy how long the day must have seemed to the
fiery Hussars, who had not yet struck one blow,
and who were anxiously longing for the opportunity
of displaying their own valour, and of avenging the
deaths of their slain comrades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>They were not to wait much longer, as we shall presently
see; for, twenty minutes later, Vivian, instead
of being at the rear of the British army, was at its
head, sabring the Imperial Guard:&mdash;'Oh the wild
charge they made!' It must be borne in mind that
the crisis of the battle had arrived; and Napoleon,
like a desperate gambler, had risked his all
by sending his masses of reserves against the attenuated
British regiments, with instructions, <em>at all
hazards</em>, to force the centre, in the rear of which
Vivian had placed himself, in a most trying position
for cavalry, exposed as they were to the fire of the
French tirailleurs. His first impression, on contemplating
the destruction which he saw around
him, was that he had come, once more, to cover a
retreat of the Anglo-allied army: and, indeed, but
for the exertions of himself and others&mdash;actually using
the flats of their sabres&mdash;the contemptible Dutch-Belgian
troops, who formed Wellington's second
line, would have probably fled from the field, and
have left a hideous and fatal gap in the British line.</p>

<p>But Adams's infantry brigade had swept, like a
triumphant wave, the front of the Allied line, and
the moment had arrived when a daring charge by
fresh cavalry against the shattered Imperial Guard
and the French cavalry reserves round La Belle
Alliance, was all that was wanting to secure the
impending victory. Vivian was the happy man
upon whom this glorious task devolved. He moved
out to the rear of Alten's division, and thus clearing
himself from the British infantry, advanced directly
to the front by the right of Maitland's brigade of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
Guards. His orders from the Duke were not to
attack till the infantry came up to his support,
unless he was '<em>confident of success</em>.'</p>

<p>At this juncture, Sir Hussey Vivian&mdash;encouraged
by the cheers of his comrades, heard above the
fierce trumpet-blasts, by the ringing of scabbards
as the swords leaped forth, and by the victorious omen
bestowed by a crimson gleam of the rapidly setting
sun, which now pierced and incarnadined the smoke
and clouds&mdash;charged in echelons of regiments; the
10th, headed by himself, leading: and with that
regiment he dispersed and drove in the cavalry
posted in the front and on the left of the squares
of the Old Guard. No sooner was this done, than,
galloping to his left, he led on the 18th, also in
person, against the Cuirassiers of De Lorte, who
were on the right of that veteran body; the 1st
Hussars of the German Legion following. In a
few minutes the dazzling helmets of the French
Cuirassiers and the spears of their Lancers were seen
scattered in every direction! At the same time the
2nd King's German Legion, which Wellington had
moved up to support Vivian, successfully charged
a body of Cuirassiers on the right of the 10th; and
although this corps was in its turn assailed by fresh
Cuirassiers, and thrown into disorder, it quickly
rallied, and soon drove the French off that part
of the field. The squares of the Guard were
thus laid bare, and the artillery in the intervals
opened a heavy fire on the British horse; but
Vivian, dashing on, captured the guns, twenty-four
in number, <em>before any foot-soldier on his left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
arrived</em>. Then, seeing the Osnaburgh red-coats coming
up to his support, he ventured to attack the squares
themselves. Such was the ardour of the men, that a
squadron of the 10th, having re-formed after taking the
artillery, and Vivian himself leading them, charged
one of the squares with unparalleled vehemence.
That attack was, after a short struggle, at first
repulsed by the steady fire of the veteran French
grenadiers. The French square, nevertheless, fell
back after the shock, still keeping up a rolling fire
on its opponents, who never ceased to cut at them
till they too were lost in the crowd of fugitives.
About this time Vandeleur's brigade came up. It
charged upon Vivian's right, defeating a body of
French infantry, who were formed in square, and
who were endeavouring to restore the battle in that
quarter; but the rout was now complete.</p>

<p>Wellington, encouraged by the rapid and beautiful
style in which Vivian's brigade advanced, and by
the brilliant success of the attack, now ordered,
amid the enthusiastic cheering of the troops, the
long-looked-for general advance of the whole line.
That this was, as Siborne well describes it, 'a
march of triumph rather than of attack,' is matter
of history. The battle of Waterloo was won; and
the British General's prediction was verified, in the
words of Scott, that 'England should tell the fight.'</p>

<p>That night Vivian and his exhausted Hussars,
satiated with their bloody victory, bivouacked in
advance of the main body of the English at the
little village of Hilaincourt; while the fresh Prussian
troops followed up the retreat of the flying French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>One or two episodes in this memorable achievement
have been recorded by Captain Malet, in his
'History of the 18th Hussars.' As at Balaclava,
there came an order which</p>

<p class="center small">'Some one had blunder'd:'</p>

<p>the leading half-squadron, in the final charge, was
wheeling in precisely the wrong direction, which
Vivian perceiving, at once rode up to rectify, exclaiming,
says Malet, 'with emphasis, and a good
hearty d&mdash;&mdash;, that it was <em>towards</em> the enemy he
wanted them to wheel!'</p>

<p>Again, after the 18th regiment had been led to the
charge, Vivian, on returning (with his arm in a
sling, the result of the wound at Croix d'Orade)
to lead on the 10th also, was intercepted by a
straggling French cuirassier, who cut at the English
General. Taking his reins, however, in his right
hand, which was barely able to grasp them, Vivian
not only parried the blow with his sword in his left
hand, but also contrived to wound his antagonist in
the neck. This unequal combat might possibly
have ended fatally for the gallant Cornishman, had
not his German orderly galloped up at this moment,
and cut the luckless Frenchman down.</p>

<p>Vivian's own account of the affair, as contained in
the following extract from a letter written by him
soon after the battle to Mr. Pendarves, will probably
be read with interest:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1-5" />
<p class="pxx right">'St. Benir, in part of the Ch√¢teau, 23rd June, 1815. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>'... About six o'clock, however, I learnt that the
cavalry in the centre had suffered dreadfully, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
the Prussians about that time having formed to my
left, I took upon myself to move off from our left,
and halted directly to the centre of our line, where I
arrived most opportunely at the instant that Bonaparte
was making his last and most desperate effort;
and never did I witness anything so terrific&mdash;the
ground actually covered with dead and dying,
cannon-shot and shells flying thicker than I ever
heard even musketry before, and our troops some of
them giving way. In this state of affairs, I wheeled
my brigade into line, close (within ten yards) in the
rear of our infantry, and prepared to charge the
instant they had retreated through my intervals (the
three squadron officers of the 10th were wounded
at this instant); this, however, gave them confidence,
and the brigades that were literally running
away halted on our cheering them, and again began
firing. The enemy on their part began to waver;
the Duke observed it, and ordered the infantry to
advance. I immediately wheeled the brigade by
half-squadrons to the right and in column over
the dead and dying, trotted round the right of our
infantry, passed the French infantry, and formed
lines of regiments on the first half-squadrons.</p>

<p>'With the 10th I charged a body of French
Cuirassiers and Lancers infinitely superior to them,
and completely routed them. I then went to the
18th, and charged a second body that was supporting
a square of Imperial Guards; and the
18th not only defeated them, but took fourteen
pieces of cannon that had been firing grape at
us during our movement. I then, with the 10th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
having re-formed them, charged a square of infantry
(Imperial Guards), the men of which we cut down
in the ranks; and here the last shot was fired.
From this moment all was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de route</i>.</p>

<p>'Whether the Duke will do my brigade justice or
not, I know not; but Bonaparte has given them
their due in his account. We are the cavalry that
he alludes to, where at the end he says, "At eight
o'clock," etc.; and the Colonel of the 3rd Chasseurs,
who lodged the night before last in the house I
occupied, last night told the proprietor "that two
regiments of British Hussars decided the affair."<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
The third regiment (1st Hussars) I kept in reserve.</p>

<p>'Of course, our loss was severe. All those returned
missing are since ascertained to have been
killed.</p>

<p>'I never saw such a day, nor anyone else. I
expect and hope that every soldier will bear a medal
with "Mont St. Jean" on it. I would rather do so
than be adorned by the brightest star that any
potentate could bestow on me....</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>For his services on this occasion Vivian received
the following decorations: viz., the Order of Maria
Theresa from the Emperor of Austria; the Order of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
St. Wladimir from the Emperor of Russia; and that
of Hanover from the Prince Regent.</p>

<p>In his despatch dated 'Waterloo, 19th June,
1815,' the day after that great and glorious victory,
the Duke says that the British army 'never, upon
any occasion, conducted itself better.... There is
no officer nor description of troops that did not
behave well. I must, however, particularly mention,
for his Royal Highness's approbation&mdash;&mdash;'
Here follows a list of heroic and illustrious names;
amongst which Truro men especially, but also all
Cornishmen, and all Englishmen, ever read, with
glowing pride, the name of our own hero, Major-General
Sir Hussey Vivian.</p>

<p>A brother-officer of Vivian's (Colonel Taylor, of
the 10th Hussars) wrote the following lines on the
occasion:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And each firm squadron forms the serried line.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>His subsequent connexion with the Waterloo
campaign may be briefly summed up in the statements
that he led the advanced guard of the British
army all the way from Waterloo to the gates of
Paris; and that, on the restoration of Louis XVIII.,
his brigade formed part of the allied army of occupation
in Picardy&mdash;services less brilliant perhaps
than those which have just been described, yet
certainly most useful and important.</p>

<p>But the reception accorded to 'the Warrior of the
West' by his native town, after the battle of Waterloo,
should not pass unnoticed. Towards the latter
part of July (the 27th was, I believe, the day) Vivian
returned home for a short time; and when it was
known that he was approaching Truro, which was
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en f√™te</i> on the occasion, numbers of the inhabitants
went out to meet him, and, taking the horses out of
his carriage, dragged it in triumph through the
streets. Several of the townsfolk had assembled at
Mr. Vivian's house, to greet the victorious hero on
his return. Amongst them was the writer's mother&mdash;then
quite a young girl&mdash;whom the tall, strong
man lifted up in his arms as if she had been an
infant, and embracing her, exclaimed to those around
him, 'There! believe me, that's the first kiss I've
had since the battle of Waterloo!' His speech to
the populace on this occasion could not be reported,
for the air was rent by their shouts; and I should
judge, from the contemporary accounts, that a similar
enthusiasm prevailed on the occasion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
public dinner which was given to him at the Truro
Assembly Rooms on the 31st July.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The army returned to England in 1818; and with
it Vivian, who now found himself, for the first time
in twenty-three years, unemployed. Great reductions
in the military establishments, of course, took
place; and on the 10th September, 1821, the 18th
Hussars was, amongst other regiments, disbanded.
On this occasion he was presented by the <em>soldiers</em>
with a silver trumpet purchased out of the proceeds
of the sale of horses which had been captured by the
regiment during the Peninsular campaign.</p>

<p>It seems hardly necessary to dwell upon the facts
of his having been despatched in 1819 to Newcastle-on-Tyne,
and thence to Glasgow, for the purpose of
quelling riots which had broken out at those places;
it will suffice to mention that the service was
promptly and efficiently performed.</p>

<p>The University of Oxford in the following year
accorded to him the high honour of the degree of
D.C.L., which, however, for some reason, he does
not seem to have taken until fourteen years afterwards.
In 1820 he was elected a Member of Parliament
for his native town, and represented it for five
or six years.</p>

<p>In 1827 he received a Colonelcy of the Life
Guards; and in the following year he was created a
baronet&mdash;a coat of arms full of heraldic allusions to
his distinguished career being at the same time
granted to him.</p>

<p>For the five years, 1825-30, Vivian represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
Windsor in the House of Commons; but the failing
health of Lady Vivian, and his appointment to the
command of the forces in Ireland, caused him to
retire from Parliament. It is said that during this
period he was offered the post of Secretary-at-War,
but that he declined it on account of his preference
for the more active duties of his profession. Whilst
in Parliament he seldom failed to speak on all
military questions; he also took part in the debates
on Catholic Emancipation (of which he was a
supporter), and on the distress which prevailed in
the country in 1830. Polwhele thought highly of his
fluent eloquence; and I am told by Mr. H. S. Stokes
that Vivian was remarkably successful in his addresses
to election mobs. In this year he attained the
rank of Lieutenant-General; and about the same
time William IV. made him a Grand Cross of the
Royal Hanoverian Order of Guelph.</p>

<p>In 1833 (the first Lady Vivian having died)
Vivian married a second time; the lady of his choice
being L√¶titia, third daughter of the Rev. J. A.
Webster, by whom he had one daughter, Lalage.
Four years afterwards he again entered Parliament,
this time as a representative of the Eastern Division
of Cornwall; having, however, been previously made
a Privy Councillor in 1834, and having filled, with
distinction, for four or five years the historic post of
Master-General of the Ordnance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Little remains to be told of his history. On his
retirement from the above post, he was created a
peer, and took his seat in the Upper House as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
Baron Vivian of Glynn and Truro, the patent being
dated 11th August, 1841. His last-earned honour he
did not enjoy for more than a year; for, on the 20th
August, 1842, he died suddenly at Baden-Baden.</p>

<p>On the 13th of the following month the little town
of Truro presented a doleful contrast to that which
it bore some twenty-seven years before, when her
brave son returned in the full flush of victory. All
business was entirely suspended in order that the
townsfolk might receive, at the town quay, Vivian's
mortal remains; they were brought up the river from
Falmouth, and carried to the church, which was
draped in black. He was buried at St. Mary's
Cemetery, in the same vault with his father and
mother, against the eastern wall of the enclosure;
but no inscription marks the spot. His epitaph
which was in St. Mary's Church (now the new
cathedral), need not be inserted here, for his career
has been described in the foregoing pages, and it
will be perhaps sufficient to quote the description
of his character as summarized by Dr. Wolcot&mdash;no
lenient critic:</p>
